You can do this using normal reagents and the Craft activity, or you can use special infused reagents that allow you to craft temporary items quickly and at no cost. Over time, you can create more and more alchemical items for free, and since each of them becomes more and more powerful, you advance in power dramatically, leaving behind those who don't understand your strange science. You gain the Alchemical Crafting feat (page 258), even if you don't meet that feat's prerequisites, and you gain the four common 1st-level alchemical formulas granted by that feat. The catalog of alchemical items begins on page 543. You can use this feat to create alchemical items as long as you have the items' formulas in your formula book.	DESC:&nl;Infused Reagents - You infuse reagents with your own alchemical essence, allowing you to create alchemical items at no cost. Each day during your daily preparations, you gain a number of batches of infused reagents equal to your level + your Intelligence modifier. You can use these reagents for either advanced alchemy or Quick Alchemy, described below. Together, these infused reagents have light Bulk. As soon as you make your next daily preparations, your infused reagents from the previous day's preparations are instantly destroyed, and nonpermanent effects of your previous day's infused items immediately end. While infused reagents are physical objects, they can't be duplicated, preserved, or created in any way other than your daily preparations. Any such artificial reagents lack the infusion and are useless for advanced alchemy or Quick Alchemy.		DESC:&nl;Advanced Alchemy - During your daily preparations, after producing new infused reagents, you can spend batches of those infused reagents to create infused alchemical items. You don't need to attempt a Crafting check to do this, and you ignore both the number of days typically required to create the items and any alchemical reagent requirements. Your advanced alchemy level is equal to your level. For each batch of infused reagents you spend, choose an alchemical item of your advanced alchemy level or lower that's in your formula book, and make a batch of two of that item. These items have the infused trait and remain potent for 24 hours or until your next daily preparations, whichever comes first.

# Bard
Occult Spellcasting									KEY:Bard Class Feature ~ Occult Spellcasting			CATEGORY:Class Feature		TYPE:Bard Class Feature.Class Feature.Display					DESC:You have the power to cast occult spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you gain access to the Material Casting, Somatic Casting, and Verbal Casting actions (see Casting Spells on page 195). Because you're a bard, you can usually play an instrument as part of your Material Casting and Somatic Casting actions, so you usually don't need spell components or another hand free. You can usually also play an instrument for your Verbal Casting actions rather than speaking. Each day, you can cast up to two 1st-level spells. The number of spells you can cast each day are called your spell slots. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. As you increase in level as a bard, your number of spells per day and the highest level of spells you can cast from spell slots increases, as shown on the Bard Spells per Day table on page 65. Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC. Since your key ability is Charisma, your spell rolls and spell DCs use your Charisma modifier. See page 291 for details on calculating your spell rolls and spell DCs.
Heightening Spells									KEY:Bard Class Feature ~ Heightening Spells			CATEGORY:Class Feature		TYPE:Bard Class Feature.Class Feature.Display					DESC:When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can heighten lowerlevel spells to higher levels. You must learn them at the new level to do so, as described on page 192. The spontaneous heightening class feature lets you select two spells you can heighten freely.
Cantrips											KEY:Bard Class Feature ~ Cantrips					CATEGORY:Class Feature		TYPE:Bard Class Feature.Class Feature.Display					DESC:Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to the highest level of spell you can cast as a bard. For example, as a 1stlevel bard, the highest level of spell you can cast is 1st, so your cantrips are 1st-level spells. As a 5th-level bard, the highest level of spell you can cast is 3rd, so your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.
Spell Repertoire										KEY:Bard Class Feature ~ Spell Repertoire				CATEGORY:Class Feature		TYPE:Bard Class Feature.Class Feature.Display					DESC:At 1st level, you learn one 1st-level occult spell of your choice and four occult cantrips of your choice. You choose these from the common spells on the occult spell list in this book (see page 200) or from other occult spells to which you have access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell level. You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot from Table 3-6, you add a spell to your spell repertoire of the same level. So when you reach 2nd level, you select another 1st-level spell; at 3rd level, you select two 2nd-level spells, and at 4th level you select a 2nd-level spell. Though you gain them at the same rate, your spell slots and spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it wouldn't give you another spell slot, and vice versa.	DESC:&nl;Swapping Spells in Your Repertoire - As you gain new spells in your repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you level up and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same level. This spell can be a cantrip. You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime (see page 318).
First Compositions									KEY:Bard Class Feature ~ First Compositions			CATEGORY:Class Feature		TYPE:Bard Class Feature.Class Feature.Display					DESC:Compositions are a special type of spell that require you to use the Performance skill as a part of their casting. At 1st level, bards gain two types of composition spells: composition cantrips and composition powers (which both have the composition trait). You gain the inspire courage composition cantrip (see page 233), which boosts your allies' attacks, damage, and defense against fear. This is in addition to the cantrips you choose from the occult list. Feats can give you more composition cantrips. Unlike other cantrips, you can't swap out compositions gained from bard feats at a later level, unless you swap out the specific feat via retraining (see page 318). You can also cast a composition power called counter performance (see page 212) that protects against auditory and visual effects. You have a pool of Spell Points you can spend to cast this spell. Your maximum number of Spell Points is equal to your key ability modifier (minimum 0). You regain all your Spell Points during your daily preparations. You can cast counter performance only by spending 1 Spell Point, not using spell slots. This power is automatically heightened to the highest level of spell you can cast. Some bard feats let you learn more composition powers, and such feats typically increase your pool of Spell Points.
Muses												KEY:Bard Class Feature ~ Muses					CATEGORY:Class Feature		TYPE:Bard Class Feature.Class Feature.Display					DESC:As a bard, you have a muse that leads you to great things, which might be a physical creature, a deity, a philosophy, or something more nebulous.

During your daily preparations (see page 192), you can select up to two spells you know. You can cast those spells using any applicable higher-level spell slots you have, heightening the spell to the level of spell slot used, even if you don't ordinarily know the spell at the higher level.

You can use this increase to either become trained in one skill you're untrained in, or become an expert in one skill in which you're already trained. If you are at least 7th level, you can use this increase to become a master in a signature skill in which you're already an expert. If you are at least 15th level, you can use this increase to become legendary in a signature skill in which you're already a master.

# Cleric
Divine Spellcasting									KEY:Cleric Class Feature ~ Divine Spellcasting			CATEGORY:Class Feature		TYPE:Cleric Class Feature.Class Feature.Display					DESC:You have the power to cast divine spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you gain access to the Material Casting, Somatic Casting, and Verbal Casting actions (see Spellcasting on page 195). Because you're a cleric, you can usually hold a divine focus (such as a religious symbol or a religious text) as part of your Material Casting and Somatic Casting actions, so you usually don't need spell components or another hand free. At 1st level, you can prepare two 1st-level spells and four cantrips each morning from the common spells on the divine spell list in this book (see page 200) or from other divine spells to which you gain access. Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare are called your spell slots. As you increase in level as a cleric, the number of spells you can prepare each day increases, as does the highest level of spell you can cast, as shown on the Cleric Spells per Day table on page 70. Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC. Since your key ability is Wisdom, your spell rolls and spell DCs use your Wisdom modifier. See page 291 for details on calculating your spell rolls and spell DCs.
Heightening Spells									KEY:Cleric Class Feature ~ Heightening Spells			CATEGORY:Class Feature		TYPE:Cleric Class Feature.Class Feature.Display					DESC:When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can prepare lower-level spells in those slots to strengthen them. This increases the spell's level to match the heightened spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels (see page 192).
Cantrips											KEY:Cleric Class Feature ~ Cantrips					CATEGORY:Class Feature		TYPE:Cleric Class Feature.Class Feature.Display					DESC:A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to the highest level of spell you can cast as a cleric. For example, as a 1st-level cleric, the highest level of spell you can cast is 1st, so your cantrips are 1st-level spells. As a 5th-level cleric, the highest level of spell you can cast is 3rd, so your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.
Deity and Domain										KEY:Cleric Class Feature ~ Deity and Domain			CATEGORY:Class Feature		TYPE:Cleric Class Feature.Class Feature.Display					DESC:Choose one deity you revere above all others. The most common deities in Pathfinder appear on Table 3-9: Deities on pages 72-73. This table lists each deity's name, areas of concern, and alignment, followed by the benefits you get for being a cleric of that deity. Your alignment must be one allowed by your deity, as listed in parentheses after the deity's alignment. Your deity grants you a signature skill and the trained proficiency rank with the deity's favored weapon. If the favored weapon is uncommon, you also get access to that weapon. Your deity also adds spells to your spell list. When preparing spells, you can select from these in addition to the spells on the divine list once you can cast that level of spell. Select one domain-a subject of particular interest to you within the traditions of your religion-from your deity's list of domains. This domain grants you a special kind of spell called a domain power. Each domain's theme and powers appear in Table 3-10: Domains on page 73. By choosing a domain, you gain a pool of Spell Points you can spend to cast domain powers. You can cast domain powers only by spending Spell Points, not by using spell slots. Your maximum number of Spell Points equals your key ability modifier (minimum 0). You regain all your Spell Points when you prepare your spells. You gain the initial power tied to your domain when you select the domain. Your initial domain power costs 1 Spell Point to cast and is automatically heightened to the highest level of spell you can cast. Domain powers are available only to characters who've selected the domain and can't be learned by others. Some cleric feats grant you more domain powers, and such feats typically increase your pool of Spell Points. You can learn additional powers, called advanced domain powers, by taking the Advanced Domain cleric feat. The Spell Point cost of this advanced domain power is listed in parentheses after its name in Table 3-10: Domains.
Anathema											KEY:Cleric Class Feature ~ Anathema					CATEGORY:Class Feature		TYPE:Cleric Class Feature.Class Feature.Display					DESC:Actions fundamentally opposed to your deity's alignment or ideals are anathema to your faith. Committing acts, learning or casting spells, and using items that are anathema to your deity take you out of that deity's good graces. Casting spells with the evil trait is almost always anathema to good deities, and casting good spells is likewise anathema to evil deities; similarly, casting chaotic spells is anathema to lawful deities and casting lawful spells is anathema to chaotic deities. A neutral cleric who worships a neutral deity isn't limited this way, but their alignment might change over time if they frequently cast spells or use abilities with a certain alignment. Similarly, casting spells that are anathema to the tenets or goals of your faith could interfere with your connection to your deity. For example, casting a spell to enhance your ability to lie would be anathema to Sarenrae, as a goddess of honesty, and casting one to create undead would be anathema to Pharasma, the goddess of death. For borderline cases, you and your GM determine whether other acts count as anathema. For example, Torag is a god of community, so actions that work to destroy a close-knit community are typically anathema to Torag. However, as god of dwarves, he might permit you to destroy a community of giants that is threatening to wipe out a dwarven settlement. If you perform enough acts that are anathema to your deity or if your alignment changes to one not allowed by your deity, you lose the magical abilities that come from your connection to your deity. The class features that you lose are determined by the GM, but they likely include channel energy, domain powers, and divine spellcasting. These abilities can be regained only if you demonstrate your repentance by conducting an atone ritual (see page 275).
Channel Energy										KEY:Cleric Class Feature ~ Channel Energy				CATEGORY:Class Feature		TYPE:Cleric Class Feature.Class Feature.Display					DESC:You gain a pool of positive or negative energy, depending on your deity, as shown on Table 3-9: Deities on pages 72-73. Some deities allow you to choose whether to channel negative or positive energy. Once you choose, you can't change the type of energy you channel, short of an ethical shift or divine intervention. This pool of energy allows you to cast either the heal spell (for positive energy) or the harm spell (for negative energy) a number of times per day equal to 3 plus your Charisma modifier without needing to prepare the spell in advance. All spells you cast in this way are heightened to the maximum spell level you can cast as a cleric. You can find heal on page 229 and harm on page 228.
Cleric Feats										KEY:Cleric Class Feature ~ Cleric Feats				CATEGORY:Class Feature		TYPE:Cleric Class Feature.Class Feature.Display					DESC:At 2nd level, you gain a cleric class feat (see page 74). You gain another at 4th, 6th, 8th, 10th, 14th, 18th, and 20th levels.
Skill Feats											KEY:Cleric Class Feature ~ Skill Feats				CATEGORY:Class Feature		TYPE:Cleric Class Feature.Class Feature.Display					DESC:At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. Skill feats can be found in Chapter 5 and have the skill trait. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.
General Feats										KEY:Cleric Class Feature ~ General Feats				CATEGORY:Class Feature		TYPE:Cleric Class Feature.Class Feature.Display					DESC:At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat. General feats are listed in Chapter 5.

You can use this increase to either become trained in one skill you're untrained in, or become an expert in one skill in which you're already trained. If you are at least 7th level, you can use this increase to become a master in a signature skill in which you're already an expert. If you are at least 15th level, you can use this increase to become legendary in a signature skill in which you're already a master.

# Druid
Primal Spellcasting									KEY:Druid Class Feature ~ Primal Spellcasting			CATEGORY:Class Feature		TYPE:Druid Class Feature.Class Feature.Display					DESC:You have the power to cast primal spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you gain access to the Material Casting, Somatic Casting, and Verbal Casting actions (see Casting Spells on page 195). Because you're a druid, you can usually hold a primal focus (such as holly and mistletoe) as part of your Material Casting and Somatic Casting actions, so you usually don't need spell components or another hand free. At 1st level, you can prepare two 1st-level spells and four cantrips each morning from the common spells on the primal spell list in this book (see page 201), or from other primal spells to which you gain access. Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare are called your spell slots. As you increase in level as a druid, the number of spells you can prepare each day increases, as does the highest level of spell you can cast, as shown on the Druid Spells per Day table on page 81. Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC. Since your key ability is Wisdom, your spell rolls and spell DCs use your Wisdom modifier. See page 291 for details on calculating your spell rolls and spell DCs.
Heightening Spells									KEY:Druid Class Feature ~ Heightening Spells			CATEGORY:Class Feature		TYPE:Druid Class Feature.Class Feature.Display					DESC:When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can prepare lower-level spells in those slots to strengthen them. This increases the spell's level to match the heightened spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels (see page 192).
Cantrips											KEY:Druid Class Feature ~ Cantrips					CATEGORY:Class Feature		TYPE:Druid Class Feature.Class Feature.Display					DESC:A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to the highest level of spell you can cast as a druid. For example, as a 1st-level druid, the highest level of spell you can cast is 1st, so your cantrips are 1st-level spells. As a 5th-level druid, the highest level of spell you can cast is 3rd, so your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.
Anathema											KEY:Druid Class Feature ~ Anathema					CATEGORY:Class Feature		TYPE:Druid Class Feature.Class Feature.Display					DESC:As stewards of the natural order, druids find affronts to nature anathema. If you perform enough acts that are anathema to nature, you lose your magical abilities that come from the druid class, including your primal spellcasting and the benefits of your order. These abilities can be regained only if you demonstrate your repentance by conducting an atone ritual (see page 275). The following acts are anathema to all druids: * Using metal armor or shields. * Despoiling natural places. * Teaching the Druidic language to nondruids. Each druidic order also has additional anathema acts.
Druidic Order										KEY:Druid Class Feature ~ Druidic Order				CATEGORY:Class Feature		TYPE:Druid Class Feature.Class Feature.Display					DESC:Upon becoming a druid, you align yourself with a druidic order, which grants you a class feat, an order power (see below), and an additional signature skill tied to your order. Though you can still gain class feats tied to other orders as you advance, you receive additional benefits when using abilities tied to your chosen order. You gain a pool of Spell Points. Your maximum number of Spell Points is equal to your key ability modifier. You regain all your Spell Points when you prepare your spells (see Daily Preparations on page 192). You also gain a special spell tied to your order, which is called an order power. You cast this order power by spending 1 Spell Point, not by using spell slots. Your order power is automatically heightened to the highest level of spell you can cast. Some druid feats grant you more order powers and increase your pool of Spell Points. The druidic orders presented in this book are as follows.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Druidic Order|1
Druidic Language										KEY:Druid Class Feature ~ Druidic Language			CATEGORY:Class Feature		TYPE:Druid Class Feature.Class Feature.Display					DESC:You know Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, in addition to any languages you know through your ancestry. Druidic has its own alphabet. If you use sign languages instead of spoken languages, you know the sign language version of Druidic. Teaching the Druidic language to nondruids is anathema (see page 80).
Wild Empathy										KEY:Druid Class Feature ~ Wild Empathy				CATEGORY:Class Feature		TYPE:Druid Class Feature.Class Feature.Display					DESC:You have a connection to the creatures of the natural world that allows you to communicate with them on a rudimentary level. You can use Diplomacy to Make an Impression on animals and to make very simple Requests of them.

Skill Increases										KEY:Druid Class Feature ~ Skill Increases				CATEGORY:Class Feature		TYPE:Druid Class Feature.Class Feature.Display					DESC:At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase to either become trained in one skill you're untrained in, or become an expert in one skill in which you're already trained. If you are at least 7th level, you can use this increase to become a master in a signature skill in which you're already an expert. If you are at least 15th level, you can use this increase to become legendary in a signature skill in which you're already a master.
Expert Spellcaster									KEY:Druid Class Feature ~ Expert Spellcaster			CATEGORY:Class Feature		TYPE:Druid Class Feature.Class Feature.Display					DESC:Your proficiency rank for spell rolls, spell DCs, and attack rolls for primal spells increases to expert.

Finally, as your order power, you can cast heal animal at a cost of 1 Spell Point. Committing wanton cruelty to animals or killing animals unnecessarily is anathema to your order.

You are trained in Acrobatics, and it becomes a signature skill for you. You also gain the Storm Born druid feat. Finally, as your order power, you can cast tempest surge at a cost of 1 Spell Point.

You are trained in Intimidation, and it becomes a signature skill for you. You also gain the Wild Shape druid feat. Finally, as your order power, you can cast wild claws at a cost of 1 Spell Point. Becoming fully domesticated by the temptations of civilization is anathema to your order. (This doesn't prevent you from buying and using processed goods or staying in a city for an adventure, but you can never come to rely on these conveniences or truly call such a place your permanent home.)

# Paladin
Code of Conduct										KEY:Paladin Class Feature ~ Code of Conduct			CATEGORY:Class Feature		TYPE:Paladin Class Feature.Class Feature.Display				DESC:Paladins are divine champions of a deity. You must be lawful good and worship a deity that allows lawful good clerics. See the list of deities on page 72. Actions fundamentally opposed to your deity's alignment or ideals are anathema to your faith. A few examples of acts that would be considered anathema appear in each deity's entry. You and your GM will determine whether other acts count as anathema. In addition, you must follow the paladin's code below. Deities often add additional strictures for their own paladins (for instance, Shelyn's paladins never attack first except to protect an innocent, and they choose and perfect an art form). If you stray from lawful good, perform acts anathema to your deity, or violate your code of conduct, you lose your Spell Point pool and righteous ally until you demonstrate your repentance by conducting an atone ritual (see page 275), but keep any other paladin abilities that don't require those class features.
The Paladin's Code									KEY:Paladin Class Feature ~ The Paladin's Code			CATEGORY:Class Feature		TYPE:Paladin Class Feature.Class Feature.Display				DESC:The following is the fundamental code all paladins follow. The tenets are listed in order of importance, starting with the most important. If a situation places two tenets in conflict, you aren't in a no-win situation; instead, follow the most important tenet. For instance, if an evil king asked you if innocent lawbreakers were hiding in your church so he could execute them, you could lie to him, since the tenet forbidding you to lie is less important than the tenet prohibiting the harm of an innocent. An attempt to subvert the paladin code by engineering a situation allowing you to use a higher tenet to ignore a lower tenet (telling someone that you won't respect lawful authorities so that the tenet of not lying supersedes the tenet of respecting lawful authorities, for example) is a violation of the paladin code. * You must never willingly commit an evil act, such as murder, torture, or the casting an evil spell. * You must not use actions that you know will harm an innocent, or through inaction cause an innocent immediate harm when you knew your action could reasonably prevent it. This tenet doesn't force you to take action against possible harm to innocents or to sacrifice your life and potential to attempt to protect an innocent. * You must act with honor, never cheating, lying, or taking advantage of others. * You must respect the lawful authority of the legitimate ruler or leadership in whichever land you may be, following their laws unless they violate a higher tenet.
Deific Weapon										KEY:Paladin Class Feature ~ Deific Weapon				CATEGORY:Class Feature		TYPE:Paladin Class Feature.Class Feature.Display				DESC:If your deity's favored weapon (see page 72) is uncommon, you gain access to it. If the weapon is simple, increase the damage die by one step when you wield it (d4 to d6, d6 to d8, d8 to d10, d10 to d12).
Retributive Strike									KEY:Paladin Class Feature ~ Retributive Strike			CATEGORY:Class Feature		TYPE:Paladin Class Feature.Class Feature.Display				DESC:As a paladin, you are a stalwart protector of those under your charge. You gain the Retributive Strike reaction. Make a melee Strike against the triggering creature at a -2 penalty before the opponent rolls the damage for the triggering hit. If your attack hits, the target is enfeebled 1 for the remainder of its turn, or enfeebled 2 for the remainder of its turn if your Strike was a critical hit. The enfeebled condition ends immediately if the creature makes a Strike against you. If Retributive Strike incapacitates or kills the triggering creature, the triggering hit deals no damage.
Champion Powers										KEY:Paladin Class Feature ~ Champion Powers			CATEGORY:Class Feature		TYPE:Paladin Class Feature.Class Feature.Display				DESC:Divine power flows through you, and you have learned to channel it to heal others. This grants you special spells called champion powers. You gain a pool of Spell Points you can spend to cast champion powers. Your maximum number of Spell Points is equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 0). You regain all your Spell Points when you prepare each day. Your key spellcasting ability score is Charisma, and you're trained in spell rolls and spell DCs for your champion powers. Your champion powers are divine spells. Champion powers are available only to paladins, and they can't be learned by other characters. They appear in the Spells chapter (page 192). Some paladin feats grant you additional champion powers, and such feats typically increase your pool of Spell Points. The spell level of each of your champion powers is equal to half your character level, rounded down, and produces heightened effects (see page 192) for those champion powers that have heightened entries. You gain the ability to cast the lay on hands champion power by spending 1 Spell Point.
Paladin Feats										KEY:Paladin Class Feature ~ Paladin Feats				CATEGORY:Class Feature		TYPE:Paladin Class Feature.Class Feature.Display				DESC:At 1st level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you gain a paladin class feat.

BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Skill Feat|(TL/2)
Righteous Ally										KEY:Paladin Class Feature ~ Righteous Ally			CATEGORY:Class Feature		TYPE:Paladin Class Feature.Class Feature.Display				DESC:Your devotion to the cause of good attracts the attention of a holy spirit to aid you on your journey. This spirit can take many forms, each granting you abilities and advantages. Once you have chosen the ally's form, it cannot be changed. The following are righteous allies: * Blade Ally: A spirit of valor inhabits your weapon, granting it additional power. Select one weapon each morning when you make your daily preparations. In your hands, the weapon gains your choice of the disrupting, ghost touch, returning, or shifting property (see page 370), without it counting against the weapon's maximum number of properties. In addition, you gain access to the weapon's critical specialization effect. * Shield Ally: A spirit of dedication inhabits your shield, granting it additional benefits. In your hands, the shield increases its Hardness by 2 and gains the ability to take 2 additional Dents before becoming broken. This stacks with any extra Dents the shield can normally take. * Steed Ally: You gain the service of a trained mount, which is treated as a young animal companion (see page 284). Normally you can select only an animal companion with the mount special ability, such as a horse. At the GM's discretion, you can select a different type of animal companion appropriate to your ancestry and culture, but it doesn't gain the mount special ability.
General Feats										KEY:Paladin Class Feature ~ General Feats				CATEGORY:Class Feature		TYPE:Paladin Class Feature.Class Feature.Display				DESC:At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat. General feats are listed in Chapter 5.

# Sorcerer
Bloodline											KEY:Sorcerer Class Feature ~ Bloodline				CATEGORY:Class Feature		TYPE:Sorcerer Class Feature.Class Feature.Display				DESC:You choose one bloodline to represent the magical ancestry that gives you your spellcasting talent. This choice determines the type of spells you cast, the spell list from which you choose your spells, additional spells you learn, and additional signature skills you gain. You also gain Spell Points and special powers based on your bloodline. See Bloodlines on pages 129-130, and Casting Spells on pages 195-196.
Sorcerer Spellcasting									KEY:Sorcerer Class Feature ~ Sorcerer Spellcasting		CATEGORY:Class Feature		TYPE:Sorcerer Class Feature.Class Feature.Display				DESC:You have the power to cast spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you gain access to the Material Casting, Somatic Casting, and Verbal Casting actions (see Casting Spells on pages 195-196). Because you're a sorcerer, you can usually replace Material Casting actions with Somatic Casting actions, so you usually don't need spell components. Each day, you can cast up to two 1st-level spells, plus an extra 1st-level spell due to the power of your bloodline. The number of spells you can cast each day are called your spell slots. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. As you increase in level as a sorcerer, your number of spells per day and the highest level of spells you can cast from spell slots increases, as shown on the Sorcerer Spells per Day table on page 129. Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC. Since your key ability is Charisma, your spell rolls and spell DCs use your Charisma modifier. See page 291 for details on calculating your spell rolls and spell DCs.
Heightening Spells									KEY:Sorcerer Class Feature ~ Heightening Spells			CATEGORY:Class Feature		TYPE:Sorcerer Class Feature.Class Feature.Display				DESC:When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can heighten lower-level spells to higher levels. You must learn them at the new level to do so, as described on page 192. The spontaneous heightening class feature lets you select two spells you can heighten freely.
Cantrips											KEY:Sorcerer Class Feature ~ Cantrips				CATEGORY:Class Feature		TYPE:Sorcerer Class Feature.Class Feature.Display				DESC:Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to the highest level of spell you can cast as a sorcerer. For example, as a 1stlevel sorcerer, the highest level of spell you can cast is 1st, so your cantrips are 1st-level spells. As a 5th-level sorcerer, the highest level of spell you can cast is 3rd, so your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.
Spell Repertoire										KEY:Sorcerer Class Feature ~ Spell Repertoire			CATEGORY:Class Feature		TYPE:Sorcerer Class Feature.Class Feature.Display				DESC:At 1st level, you learn two 1st-level spells of your choice and four cantrips of your choice, as well as an additional spell and cantrip from your bloodline (see page 130). You choose these from the common spells on the spell list corresponding to your bloodline in this book, or from other spells on that spell list to which you gain access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell level. You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot from Table 3-20, you add a spell to your spell repertoire of the same level. So when you reach 2nd level, you select another 1st-level spell; at 3rd level, you select two 2nd-level spells, and at 4th level you select a 2nd-level spell. Each time you learn spells of a new spell level, your bloodline also grants you both a new spell and a new spell slot of that level. As with other spell slots, you can use this bonus slot to cast any spell, not just the one your bloodline gave you. Though you gain them at the same rate, your spell slots and spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it wouldn't give you another spell slot, and vice versa. Swapping Spells in Your Repertoire As you gain new spells in your repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you level up and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same level. This spell can be a cantrip. You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime (see page 318).
Skill Feats											KEY:Sorcerer Class Feature ~ Skill Feats				CATEGORY:Class Feature		TYPE:Sorcerer Class Feature.Class Feature.Display				DESC:At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. Skill feats can be found in Chapter 5 and have the skill trait. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.

Skill Increases										KEY:Sorcerer Class Feature ~ Skill Increases			CATEGORY:Class Feature		TYPE:Sorcerer Class Feature.Class Feature.Display				DESC:At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase to either become trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to become an expert in one skill in which you're already trained. If you are at least 7th level, you can use this increase to become a master in a signature skill in which you're already an expert. If you are at least 15th level, you can use this increase to become legendary in a signature skill in which you're already a master.
Spontaneous Heightening									KEY:Sorcerer Class Feature ~ Spontaneous Heightening		CATEGORY:Class Feature		TYPE:Sorcerer Class Feature.Class Feature.Display				DESC:You learn to freely heighten some of your spells, even if you know only the base version of the spell. During your daily preparations (see page 192), you can pick up to two spells you know. You can cast those spells using any applicable higher-level spell slots you may have, heightening the spell to the level of spell slot used, even if you don't ordinarily know the spell at the higher level.
Expert Spellcaster									KEY:Sorcerer Class Feature ~ Expert Spellcaster			CATEGORY:Class Feature		TYPE:Sorcerer Class Feature.Class Feature.Display				DESC:Your proficiency rank for spell rolls, spell DCs, and attack rolls for your bloodline's type of spells increases to expert.
Master Spellcaster									KEY:Sorcerer Class Feature ~ Master Spellcaster			CATEGORY:Class Feature		TYPE:Sorcerer Class Feature.Class Feature.Display				DESC:Your proficiency rank for spell rolls, spell DCs, and attack rolls for your bloodline's type of spells increases to master.

# BLOODLINES
# Your magical power comes from your bloodline. Choose a bloodline as the source of your power. This bloodline has a major influence on your abilities, primarily by determining your spell list and the type of spells you cast. Your bloodline also grants you bloodline powers, which are special spells unique to sorcerers of your lineage, and a pool of Spell Points you can use to cast these powers. You can cast a bloodline power only by spending 1 or more Spell Points, not by using spell slots. Like cantrips, bloodline powers are automatically heightened to the highest level of spell you can cast. At 1st level, your maximum number of Spell Points is equal to your key ability modifier. As you gain advanced and greater bloodline powers, you also gain additional Spell Points, as indicated in your bloodline next to the power's entry. You refresh all your Spell Points during daily preparations.

# Wizard
Arcane Spellcasting		KEY:Wizard Class Feature ~ Arcane Spellcasting		CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Wizard Class Feature.Class Feature.Display															DESC:You have the power to cast arcane spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and gain access to the Material Casting, Somatic Casting, and Verbal Casting actions (see Casting Spells on page 195). At 1st level you can prepare up to two 1st-level spells and four cantrips each morning from the spells in your spellbook (see page 137), plus one extra cantrip and spell of your chosen school of each level you can cast if you are a specialist wizard. Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare are called your spell slots. As you increase in level as a wizard, your number of spell slots and the highest level of spells you can cast from spell slots increase, as shown on the Wizard Spells per Day table on page 137. Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC. Since your key ability is Intelligence, your spell rolls and spell DCs use your Intelligence modifier. See page 291 for details on calculating your spell rolls and spell DCs.
Heightening Spells		KEY:Wizard Class Feature ~ Heightening Spells		CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Wizard Class Feature.Class Feature.Display															DESC:When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can prepare lower-level spells in those slots to strengthen them (see page 192). This increases the spell's level to match the heightened spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels.
Cantrips				KEY:Wizard Class Feature ~ Cantrips				CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Wizard Class Feature.Class Feature.Display															DESC:A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to the highest level of spell you can cast as a wizard. For example, as a 1st-level wizard, the highest level of spell you can cast is 1st, so your cantrips are 1st-level spells. As a 5th-level wizard, the highest level of spell you can cast is 3rd, so your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.
Spellbook				KEY:Wizard Class Feature ~ Spellbook			CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Wizard Class Feature.Class Feature.Display															DESC:You start with a spellbook worth 10 sp or less (as detailed on page 187), which you receive for free. The spellbook contains your choice of 10 arcane cantrips and eight 1stlevel arcane spells. You choose these from the common spells on the arcane spell list from this book (see page 199) or from other arcane spells you gain access to. Each time you gain a level, you automatically add two more arcane spells to your spellbook. These can be of any level of spell you can cast. You can also use the Arcana skill to add other spells that you find, as described on page 146. If you're creating a higher-level character, it's usually easiest to assume you always picked new spells of the highest level possible. At an odd-numbered level, this means that in addition to your total of 10 cantrips, your spellbook holds two spells of your highest level and four spells of all lower levels. At an even-numbered level, it means you'd have 10 cantrips and four spells of every level.
Arcane School			KEY:Wizard Class Feature ~ Arcane School			CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Wizard Class Feature.Class Feature.Display															DESC:If you want to be a specialist wizard, choose one school of magic in which to specialize. You gain one additional spell slot for each spell level you can cast, but you may use these spell slots to prepare only spells from your arcane school. You can also prepare one additional cantrip each day, which must be from your specialized school. You gain Spell Points and a special power based on your school (see Arcane Schools on page 137) and add another spell from your chosen school to your spellbook.
Arcane Focus			KEY:Wizard Class Feature ~ Arcane Focus			CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Wizard Class Feature.Class Feature.Display															DESC:You can place some of your magical power into an item called an arcane focus. Each day when you prepare your spells, you can designate a single item you own as your arcane focus. This is typically an item associated with spellcasting, such as a wand, ring, or staff, but you are free to designate a weapon or other item. You gain the Drain Arcane Focus free action.
DRAIN ARCANE FOCUS		KEY:Wizard Class Feature ~ DRAIN ARCANE FOCUS		CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Wizard Class Feature.Class Feature.Display															DESC:Frequency once per day	DESC:Trigger Your turn begins.	DESC:You expend the magical power stored in your arcane focus. This gives you the ability to cast one spell you prepared today and previously cast, without spending a spell slot. You must still complete the required spellcasting actions and meet the spell's other requirements.
Skill Feats				KEY:Wizard Class Feature ~ Skill Feats			CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Wizard Class Feature.Class Feature.Display															DESC:At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. Skill feats can be found in Chapter 5 and have the skill trait. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.
Wizard Feats			KEY:Wizard Class Feature ~ Wizard Feats			CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Wizard Class Feature.Class Feature.Display															DESC:At 2nd level, you gain a wizard class feat (see page 139). You gain another at 4th, 6th, 8th, 10th, 14th, 18th, and 20th levels.
General Feats			KEY:Wizard Class Feature ~ General Feats			CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Wizard Class Feature.Class Feature.Display															DESC:At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat. General feats are listed in Chapter 5.
Skill Increases			KEY:Wizard Class Feature ~ Skill Increases		CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Wizard Class Feature.Class Feature.Display															DESC:At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase to either become trained in one skill you're untrained in, or become an expert in one skill in which you're already trained. If you are at least 7th level, you can use this increase to become a master in a signature skill in which you're already an expert. If you are at least 15th level, you can use this increase to become legendary in a signature skill in which you're already a master.
Expert Spellcaster		KEY:Wizard Class Feature ~ Expert Spellcaster		CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Wizard Class Feature.Class Feature.Display															DESC:Your proficiency rank for spell rolls, spell DCs, and attack rolls for arcane spells increases to expert.
Master Spellcaster		KEY:Wizard Class Feature ~ Master Spellcaster		CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Wizard Class Feature.Class Feature.Display															DESC:Your proficiency rank for spell rolls, spell DCs, and attack rolls for arcane spells increases to master.
Legendary Spellcaster		KEY:Wizard Class Feature ~ Legendary Spellcaster	CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Wizard Class Feature.Class Feature.Display															DESC:Your proficiency rank for spell rolls, spell DCs, and attack rolls for arcane spells increases to legendary.

Your maximum number of Spell Points is equal to your key ability modifier (minimum 0). You regain all your Spell Points when you prepare your spells. Some feats let you learn more school power; such feats typically increase your pool of Spell Points.
