Alchemical Familiar	CATEGORY:CLASS FEAT	TYPE:Alchemist Class Feat.Class Feat.FEAT 01					PRECLASS:1,Alchemist=1	PREPCLEVEL:MIN=1	DESC:You have used alchemy to create life, a simple creature formed from alchemical materials, reagents, and a bit of your own blood. This alchemical familiar appears to be a small creature of flesh and blood, though it might have some unusual or distinguishing aspects depending on your creative process. Like other familiars, your alchemical familiar assists you in your laboratory and on adventures. The familiar uses your Intelligence modifier to determine its Perception, Acrobatics, and Stealth modifiers (see Familiars on page 217 for more information).	SOURCEPAGE:p.76
Alchemical Savant		CATEGORY:CLASS FEAT	TYPE:Alchemist Class Feat.Class Feat.FEAT 01					PRECLASS:1,Alchemist=1	PREPCLEVEL:MIN=1	PRETEXT:trained in Crafting	PREVARGTEQ:Prof_Rank_Crafting,1	DESC:You can identify alchemical items quickly. When using the Crafting skill to Identify Alchemy on an alchemical item you hold, you can do so as a single action, which has the concentrate and manipulate traits, instead of spending 10 minutes. If you have the formula for the item you are attempting to identify, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your check, and if you roll a critical failure, you get a failure instead.	SOURCEPAGE:p.76
Far Lobber			CATEGORY:CLASS FEAT	TYPE:Alchemist Class Feat.Class Feat.FEAT 01					PRECLASS:1,Alchemist=1	PREPCLEVEL:MIN=1	DESC:You've learned how to throw a longer distance. When you throw an alchemical bomb, it has a range increment of 30 feet instead of the usual 20 feet.	SOURCEPAGE:p.76

You gain poison resistance equal to half your level, and you gain a +1 status bonus to saving throws against poisons.	ASPECT:SaveBonus|+1 status bonus to saving throws against poisons and gain poison resistance %1|TL/2	SOURCEPAGE:p.77
Revivifying Mutagen	CATEGORY:CLASS FEAT	TYPE:Alchemist Class Feat.Class Feat.FEAT 02					PRECLASS:1,Alchemist=2	PREPCLEVEL:MIN=2	DESC:While under the effect of a mutagen, you can metabolize that mutagen's power to heal yourself. This uses a single action, which has the concentrate and manipulate traits. Once the action is complete, you regain 1d6 Hit Points for every 2 item levels of the mutagen (minimum 1d6), but the mutagen's duration immediately ends, even if you are under the effect of Persistent Mutagen.	SOURCEPAGE:p.77
Smoke Bomb			CATEGORY:CLASS FEAT	TYPE:Alchemist Class Feat.Class Feat.FEAT 02.Free-Action.Additive 1	PRECLASS:1,Alchemist=2	PREPCLEVEL:MIN=2	DESC:FREQUENCY - once per round	DESC:TRIGGER - You use Quick Alchemy to craft an alchemical bomb with a level at least 1 lower than your advanced alchemy level.	DESC:You cause the bomb to create a cloud of thick smoke, in addition to its normal effects. When thrown, the bomb creates a cloud of smoke in a 10-foot-radius burst. You choose which corner of the target's space (or the space in which the bomb lands) the cloud is centered on. Creatures within that area have the concealed condition, and all other creatures are concealed to them. The smoke lasts for 1 minute or until dissipated by a strong wind.	SOURCEPAGE:p.77
Calculated Splash		CATEGORY:CLASS FEAT	TYPE:Alchemist Class Feat.Class Feat.FEAT 04					PRECLASS:1,Alchemist=4	PREPCLEVEL:MIN=4	DESC:You have calculated all the angles to maximize a bomb's splash. When you throw an alchemical bomb with the splash trait, you can cause the bomb to deal splash damage equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 0) instead of the normal amount.	SOURCEPAGE:p.77
Efficient Alchemy		CATEGORY:CLASS FEAT	TYPE:Alchemist Class Feat.Class Feat.FEAT 04					PRECLASS:1,Alchemist=4	PREPCLEVEL:MIN=4	DESC:Thanks to the time you've spent studying and experimenting, you know how to scale your formulas into larger batches that don't require any additional attention. When spending downtime to Craft alchemical items, you can produce twice as many alchemical items in a single batch without spending additional preparatory time. For instance, if you are creating elixirs of life, you can craft up to eight elixirs in a single batch using downtime, rather than four. This does not reduce the amount of alchemical reagents required or other ingredients needed to craft each item, nor does it increase your rate of progress for days past the base downtime spent. This also does not change the number of items you can create in a batch using advanced alchemy.	SOURCEPAGE:p.77
Enduring Alchemy		CATEGORY:CLASS FEAT	TYPE:Alchemist Class Feat.Class Feat.FEAT 04					PRECLASS:1,Alchemist=4	PREPCLEVEL:MIN=4	DESC:You've learned how to make your personal energy last just a little bit longer when quickly brewing ad hoc concoctions.

The second elixir must also be at least 2 levels lower than your advanced alchemy level, and the combination elixir is an alchemical item two levels higher than the higher of the two elixirs' levels. When this combination elixir is consumed, both the constituent elixirs take effect. For example, you can combine two elixirs of life to create a combined elixir that heals twice the normal amount, or you can combine a lesser darkvision elixir with a lesser eagle-eye elixir to both gain darkvision and find secret doors.	SOURCEPAGE:p.78
Debilitating Bomb		CATEGORY:CLASS FEAT	TYPE:Alchemist Class Feat.Class Feat.FEAT 06.Free-Action.Additive 2	PRECLASS:1,Alchemist=6	PREPCLEVEL:MIN=6	DESC:FREQUENCY - once per round	DESC:TRIGGER - You use Quick Alchemy to craft an alchemical bomb that is at least 2 levels lower than your advanced alchemy level.	DESC:Your bombs impose additional effects on your enemies. You mix a substance into the bomb that causes one of the following: dazzled, deafened, flat-footed, or a –5-foot status penalty to Speeds. If the attack with that bomb hits, the target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or suffer that effect until the start of your next turn. Use your class DC for this saving throw (even if someone else throws the bomb).	SOURCEPAGE:p.78
Directional Bombs		CATEGORY:CLASS FEAT	TYPE:Alchemist Class Feat.Class Feat.FEAT 06					PRECLASS:1,Alchemist=6	PREPCLEVEL:MIN=6	DESC:You can lob bombs with great force and a precise trajectory to angle the splash in a cone spraying in a single direction. When throwing an alchemical bomb with the splash trait, instead of splashing all squares adjacent to the target, you can treat the target's space as the first affected square of a 15-foot cone directed away from you, potentially allowing you to avoid allies and splash deeper into enemy lines. If the target takes up more than a single square, the target's square closest to you is the first affected square of the cone.
Feral Mutagen		CATEGORY:CLASS FEAT	TYPE:Alchemist Class Feat.Class Feat.FEAT 08					PRECLASS:1,Alchemist=8	PREPCLEVEL:MIN=8	DESC:Your bestial mutagen brings out the beast lurking within you, granting you especially sharp claws and teeth as well as a ferocious appearance. Whenever you're affected by a bestial mutagen you created, you gain the mutagen's item bonus to your Intimidation checks. In addition, your claws and jaws are increasingly vicious, and they gain the deadly d10 trait. Finally, you can increase the mutagen's penalty to AC from –1 to –2 and, in exchange, increase the damage die size of your claws and jaws by one step.	SOURCEPAGE:p.79

DESC:You mix in an additive to make your bomb's contents adhere to the target and continue to deal damage. A creature that takes a direct hit from one of your sticky bombs also takes persistent damage equal to and of the same type as the bomb's splash damage. If the bomb already deals persistent damage, combine the two amounts.	SOURCEPAGE:p.79
Elastic Mutagen			CATEGORY:CLASS FEAT	TYPE:Alchemist Class Feat.Class Feat.FEAT 10	PRECLASS:1,Alchemist=10	PREPCLEVEL:MIN=10	DESC:You can cause your body to twist and flow like the quicksilver within your mutagens. Whenever you are under the effects of a quicksilver mutagen you created, you can stretch your legs and Step up to 10 feet, and you can squish and compress your body, allowing you to make it through tight spaces as if you were one size smaller, in addition to any effect from Squeezing	SOURCEPAGE:p.79

DRAGON TRANSFORMATION	CATEGORY:CLASS FEAT	TYPE:Barbarian Class Feat.Class Feat	PRECLASS:1,Barbarian=16	PREPCLEVEL:MIN=16	PRETEXT:Prerequisites - dragon totem, Dragon Totem Wings	DESC:You transform into a Large form of a dragon that matches the dragon type of your dragon totem until you stop raging, gaining the dragon trait in addition to your normal traits while in this form. You must have enough space to expand into, or your transformation fails. All your gear is absorbed into your form; the constant abilities of your gear still function, but you can't activate any item abilities. When you transform, you gain the following. * Ignore your armor's check penalty and Speed reduction, if any. * One or more melee unarmed Strikes depending on your dragon form (see page 218), which are the only type of attacks you can use. You're trained with them. When attacking with them, your damage bonus is +6. These are Strength-based attacks (for the purposes of the enfeebled condition, for example). * Temporary Hit Points equal to the amount you gain when you are raging. * Resistance 10 against the damage type of your breath weapon. * Blindsense 60 feet, darkvision. * Speed 40 feet and fly Speed 100 feet. * A breath weapon you can activate by spending 2 actions. A creature that succeeds at a DC 24 saving throw takes half damage, no damage on a critical success, and double damage on a critical failure. The saving throw is a Reflex save unless stated otherwise in the special ability description. Once you activate your breath weapon, you can't use it again for 1d4 rounds. Your breath weapon is an arcane evocation effect with the appropriate damage trait. The shape, damage, damage type, and saving throw type depend on your dragon form (see page 218). After you use your breath weapon, you still have to wait the full delay even if your transformation ends and you transform anew. The special statistics of your dragon form can be adjusted only by penalties, circumstance bonuses, and conditional bonuses (such as those you gain while raging). Your dragon form prevents you from casting spells or taking most actions with the manipulate trait that require your hands. (The GM determines which actions you can use if there's any doubt.) You can dismiss this effect by spending an action (this action has the rage and concentrate traits). You gain the benefits for your chosen dragon's type listed in the dragon form spell (see page 218). At 18th level, your fly Speed is accelerated 20, your damage bonus increases to +12, your breath weapon DC increases to 30, and you gain a +14 conditional bonus to breath weapon damage.

Attack rolls and skill checks by creatures on the ground take a -2 circumstance penalty. * Any creature on the ground within the area must attempt a Reflex save at the start of its turn to keep its footing and avoid falling into fissures that open up in the ground. The fissures are 40 feet deep, so anyone who falls in takes 20 bludgeoning damage. The fissures are permanent, and their walls require a DC 15 Athletics check to Climb. You automatically succeed at your saving throw to avoid any fissures you create. * Any structure or ceiling in the area has a chance to collapse. The GM makes a flat check for each structure, determining the DC for each (DC 16 for a sturdy structure, DC 14 for an average structure and most natural formations, DC 9 for a shoddy structure, or higher or lower as the GM sees fit). A collapse deals 11d6 bludgeoning damage; any creature caught in a collapse must attempt a Reflex save to escape it.	DESC:Success - Target takes half collapse damage and falls prone.	DESC:Critical Success - Target takes half collapse damage.	DESC:FAILURE - Target takes full collapse damage and falls prone.	DESC:Critical Failure - Takes full collapse damage and falls into a fissure. Your Quaking Stomp might have additional effects in certain types of terrain.

For example, if the spell's target successfully saved against a combined spell, it would take the "Succeed" effect of each spell, and if it critically failed it would take the "Critical Failure" effect of both spells.
