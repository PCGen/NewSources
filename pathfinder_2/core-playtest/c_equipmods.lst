# Weapon Traits - The traits a weapon has appear in this entry. Weapons can have the following traits.
Agile							SPROP:The multiple attack penalty you take on the second attack each turn with this weapon is -4 instead of -5, and -8 instead of -10 on the third and subsequent attacks in the turn.
Attached						SPROP:An attached weapon must be combined with another piece of gear in order to be used. The trait lists what type of item the weapon must be attached to. You must be wielding or wearing the item the weapon is attached to in order to attack with it. For example, shield spikes are attached to a shield, allowing you to attack with the spikes instead of a shield bash, but only if you're wielding the shield. An attached weapon is usually bolted onto or built into the item it's attached to, and typically an item can have only one weapon attached to it. An attached weapon can be removed from one item and attached to another with successful use of the Crafting skill. If an item is destroyed, its attached weapon can usually be salvaged.
Backstabber						SPROP:When you hit a flat-footed creature, this weapon deals 1 precision damage. The damage increases to 2 if the weapon is a +3 weapon.
Backswing						SPROP:You can use this weapon's momentum from a miss to lead into your next attack. After missing with this weapon on your turn, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your next attack with this weapon before the end of your turn.
Deadly						SPROP:On a critical hit, the weapon adds a weapon damage die of the listed size. Roll this after doubling the weapon’s damage. This increases to two dice if the weapon has a greater striking rune and three dice if the weapon has a major striking rune. For instance, a rapier with a greater striking rune deals 2d8 extra piercing damage on a critical hit. An ability that changes the size of the weapon’s normal damage dice doesn’t change the size of its deadly die.
Deadly d6						SPROP:On a critical hit, the weapon adds a weapon damage die of d6. This increases to two dice if the weapon has a greater striking rune and three dice if the weapon has a major striking rune.
Deadly d8						SPROP:On a critical hit, the weapon adds a weapon damage die of d8. This increases to two dice if the weapon has a greater striking rune and three dice if the weapon has a major striking rune.
Deadly d10						SPROP:On a critical hit, the weapon adds a weapon damage die of d10. This increases to two dice if the weapon has a greater striking rune and three dice if the weapon has a major striking rune.
Deadly d12						SPROP:On a critical hit, the weapon adds a weapon damage die of d12. This increases to two dice if the weapon has a greater striking rune and three dice if the weapon has a major striking rune.
Disarm						SPROP:You can use this weapon to Disarm with the Athletics skill even if you don't have a free hand. This uses the weapon's reach (if different from your own) and adds the weapon's item bonus to attack rolls (if any) as a bonus to the Athletics check. If you critically fail a check to Disarm using the weapon, you can drop the weapon to treat it as a normal failure. On a critical success, you still need a free hand if you want to take the item.
Dwarf							SPROP:Dwarves craft and use these weapons.
Elf							SPROP:Elves craft and use these weapons.
Fatal							SPROP:The fatal trait includes a die size. On a critical hit, the weapon’s damage die increases to that die size instead of the normal die size, and the weapon adds one additional damage die of the listed size.
Fatal d6						SPROP:On a critical hit, all the weapon's damage dice increase to d6, plus the weapon adds another d6 of damage.
Fatal d8						SPROP:On a critical hit, all the weapon's damage dice increase to d8, plus the weapon adds another d8 of damage.
Fatal d10						SPROP:On a critical hit, all the weapon's damage dice increase to d10, plus the weapon adds another d10 of damage.
Fatal d12						SPROP:On a critical hit, all the weapon's damage dice increase to d12, plus the weapon adds another d12 of damage.
Finesse						SPROP:You can use your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier when making attack rolls with this melee weapon. You still use Strength when calculating damage.
Forceful						SPROP:This weapon becomes more dangerous when you build up momentum. When you attack with it more than once on your turn, the second attack adds a circumstance bonus to damage equal to the number of weapon damage dice, and each subsequent attack adds a circumstance bonus to damage equal to double the number of weapon damage dice.
Free-Hand						SPROP:This weapon doesn't take up your hand, usually because it is built into your armor. A free-hand weapon can't be Disarmed. You can use the hand covered by your free-hand weapon to wield other items, perform manipulate actions, and so on. You can't attack with a free-hand weapon if you're wielding anything in that hand or using the hand for something else. When you're not wielding anything and not using the hand, you can use abilities that require you to have a hand free as well as those that require you to be wielding a weapon in that hand. Each of your hands can have only one free-hand weapon on it.
Gnome							SPROP:Gnomes craft and use these weapons.
Goblin						SPROP:Goblins craft and use these weapons.
Grapple						SPROP:You can use this weapon to Grapple with the Athletics skill even if you don’t have a free hand. This uses the weapon’s reach (if different from your own) and adds the weapon’s item bonus to attack rolls as an item bonus to the Athletics check. If you critically fail a check to Grapple using the weapon, you can drop the weapon to take the effects of a failure instead of a critical failure.
Halfling						SPROP:Halflings craft and use these weapons.
Jousting						SPROP:The weapon is suited for mounted combat with a harness or similar means. When mounted, if you moved at least 10 feet on the action before your attack, add a circumstance bonus to damage for that attack equal to the number of damage dice for the weapon. In addition, while mounted, you can wield the weapon in one hand, changing the damage die to the listed value.
Monk							SPROP:Many monks learn to use these weapons.
Nonlethal						SPROP:Attacks with this weapon are nonlethal (see page 453), and are used to knock creatures unconscious instead of kill them. You can use a nonlethal weapon to make a lethal attack with a –2 circumstance penalty.
Orc							SPROP:Orcs craft and use these weapons.
Parry							SPROP:This weapon can be used defensively to block attacks. While wielding this weapon, you can spend an Interact action to position your weapon defensively, gaining a +1 circumstance bonus to AC until the start of your next turn.
Propulsive						SPROP:You add half your Strength modifier (if positive) to damage rolls with a propulsive ranged weapon. If you have a negative Strength modifier, you add your full Strength modifier instead.
Reach							SPROP:This weapon is long and can be used to attack creatures up to 10 feet away instead of only adjacent creatures. For creatures that already have reach with the limb or limbs that wield the weapon, the weapon increases their reach by 5 feet.
Thrown						SPROP:You can throw this weapon as a ranged attack. A thrown weapon adds your Strength modifier to damage just like a melee weapon does. When this trait appears on a melee weapon, it also includes the range increment in feet. Ranged weapons with this trait use the range increment specified in the weapon's range entry.
Shove							SPROP:You can use this weapon to Shove with the Athletics skill even if you don’t have a free hand. This uses the weapon’s reach (if different from your own) and adds the weapon’s item bonus to attack rolls as an item bonus to the Athletics check. If you critically fail a check to Shove using the weapon, you can drop the weapon to take the effects of a failure instead of a critical failure.
Sweep							SPROP:This weapon makes wide sweeping or spinning attacks, making it easier to attack multiple enemies. When you attack with this weapon, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your attack roll if you already attempted to attack a different target this turn using this weapon.
Thrown 10						SPROP:You can throw this weapon as a ranged attack. A thrown weapon adds your Strength modifier to damage just like a melee weapon does. When this trait appears on a melee weapon, it also includes the range increment in feet. Ranged weapons with this trait use the range increment specified in the weapon's range entry.
Thrown 20						SPROP:You can throw this weapon as a ranged attack. A thrown weapon adds your Strength modifier to damage just like a melee weapon does. When this trait appears on a melee weapon, it also includes the range increment in feet. Ranged weapons with this trait use the range increment specified in the weapon's range entry.
Trip							SPROP:You can use this weapon to Trip with the Athletics skill even if you don’t have a free hand. This uses the weapon’s reach (if different from your own) and adds the weapon’s item bonus to attack rolls as an item bonus to the Athletics check. If you critically fail a check to Trip using the weapon, you can drop the weapon to take the effects of a failure instead of a critical failure.
Twin							SPROP:These weapons are used as a pair, complementing each other. When you attack with a twin weapon, you add a circumstance bonus to the damage roll equal to the weapon’s number of damage dice if you have previously attacked with a different weapon of the same type this turn. The weapons must be of the same type to benefit from this trait, but they don’t need to have the same runes.
Two-Hand						SPROP:This weapon can be wielded with two hands. Doing so changes its weapon damage die to the indicated value. This change applies to all the weapon’s damage dice, such as those from striking runes.
Two-hand d8						SPROP:This weapon can be wielded with two hands. Doing so changes its weapon damage die to d8. This change applies to all the weapon’s damage dice, such as those from striking runes.
Two-hand d10					SPROP:This weapon can be wielded with two hands. Doing so changes its weapon damage die to d10. This change applies to all the weapon’s damage dice, such as those from striking runes.
Two-hand d12					SPROP:This weapon can be wielded with two hands. Doing so changes its weapon damage die to d12. This change applies to all the weapon’s damage dice, such as those from striking runes.
Unarmed						SPROP:An unarmed attack uses your body rather than a manufactured weapon. An unarmed attack isn’t a weapon, though it’s categorized with weapons for weapon groups, and it might have weapon traits. Since it’s part of your body, an unarmed attack can’t be Disarmed. It also doesn’t take up a hand, though a fist or other grasping appendage follows the same rules as a free-hand weapon.
Versatile						SPROP:A versatile weapon can be used to deal a different type of damage than the type listed in the damage entry. This trait indicates the alternate damage type.
Versatile B						SPROP:A versatile B weapon can be used to deal bludgeoning damage.
Versatile P						SPROP:A versatile P weapon can be used to deal piercing damage.
Versatile S						SPROP:A versatile S weapon can be used to deal slashing damage.
Volley						SPROP:This ranged weapon is less effective at close distances. Your attacks against targets that are at a distance within the range listed take a –2 penalty.

# Critical Specialization Effects
Axe							SPROP:Critical Specialization Effect: Choose one creature adjacent to the initial target and within reach. If its AC is lower than your attack roll result for the critical hit, you deal damage to that creature equal to the result of the weapon damage die you rolled (including extra dice for its potency rune, if any). This amount isn’t doubled, and no bonuses or other additional dice apply to this damage.
Bomb							SPROP:Critical Specialization Effect: Increase the radius of the bomb’s splash damage (if any) to 10 feet.
Bow							SPROP:Critical Specialization Effect: If the target of the critical hit is adjacent to a surface, it gets stuck to that surface by the missile. The target is immobilized and must spend an Interact action to attempt a DC 10 Athletics check to pull the missile free; it can’t move from its space until it succeeds. The creature doesn’t become stuck if it is incorporeal, is liquid (like a water elemental or some oozes), or could otherwise escape without effort.
Brawling						SPROP:Critical Specialization Effect: The target must succeed at a Fortitude save against your class DC or be slowed 1 until the end of your next turn.
Club							SPROP:Critical Specialization Effect: You knock the target away from you up to 10 feet (you choose the distance). This is forced movement.

Knife							SPROP:Critical Specialization Effect: The target takes 1d6 persistent bleed damage. You gain an item bonus to this bleed damage equal to the weapon’s item bonus to attack rolls.
Pick							SPROP:Critical Specialization Effect: The weapon viciously pierces the target, who takes 2 additional damage per weapon damage die.
Polearm						SPROP:Critical Specialization Effect: The target is moved 5 feet in a direction of your choice. This is forced movement.
Shield						SPROP:Critical Specialization Effect: You knock the target back from you 5 feet. This is forced movement.
