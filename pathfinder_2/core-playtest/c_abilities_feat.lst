CHARMING LIAR			CATEGORY:Feat	TYPE:General.Skill	PREPCLEVEL:MIN=1		PREVARGTEQ:Modifier_Deception,1			PRETEXT:Prerequisites trained in Deception										DESC:Your charm allows you to win over those you lie to. When you get a critical success using the Lie action, the target's attitude toward you improves by one step, as though you'd succeeded at using Diplomacy to Make an Impression. This works only once per conversation, and if you critically succeed against multiple targets using the same result, you choose one creature's attitude to improve. You must be lying to impart seemingly important information, inflate your status, or ingratiate yourself, which trivial or irrelevant lies can't achieve.

CLOSE MATCH				CATEGORY:Feat	TYPE:General.Skill	PREPCLEVEL:MIN=1		PREVARGTEQ:Modifier_Deception,1			PRETEXT:Prerequisites trained in Deception										DESC:You're androgynous, look a bit older or younger than you are, or look like you might have an ancestry other than your own.

CONTINUAL RECOVERY				CATEGORY:Feat	TYPE:General.Skill	PREPCLEVEL:MIN=2		PREVARGTEQ:Modifier_Medicine,2			PRETEXT:Prerequisites expert in Medicine								DESC:You zealously monitor a patient's progress to administer treatment faster.

COURTLY GRACES			CATEGORY:Feat	TYPE:General.Skill	PREPCLEVEL:MIN=1		PREVARGTEQ:Modifier_Society,1			PRETEXT:Prerequisites trained in Society											DESC:You were raised among the nobility or have learned proper etiquette and bearing, allowing you to present yourself as a noble and play games of influence and politics. You can use Society to Make an Impression on a noble, as well as with Impersonate to pretend to be a noble if you aren't one. If you want to impersonate a specific noble, you still need to use Deception to Impersonate normally, and to Lie when necessary.

CRAFT ANYTHING			CATEGORY:Feat	TYPE:General.Skill	PREPCLEVEL:MIN=15		PREVARGTEQ:Modifier_Crafting,4			PRETEXT:Prerequisites legendary in Crafting											DESC:You can find ways to craft just about anything, despite restrictions. As long as you have the appropriate Crafting skill feat (such as Magical Crafting for magic items) and meet the item's level and proficiency requirement, you ignore just about any other requirement, such as being of a specific ancestry or providing spells. The only exceptions are requirements that add to the item's cost, including castings of spells that themselves have a cost, and requirements of special items such as the philosopher's stone that have exclusive means of access and Crafting. The GM decides whether you can ignore a requirement.

DIEHARD				CATEGORY:Feat	TYPE:General	PREPCLEVEL:MIN=1																				DESC:It takes more to kill you than most. You die from the dying condition at dying 5, rather than dying 4.

DIVINE GUIDANCE			CATEGORY:Feat	TYPE:General.Skill	PREPCLEVEL:MIN=15		PREVARGTEQ:Modifier_Religion,4			PRETEXT:Prerequisites legendary in Religion					DESC:You're so immersed in divine scripture that you find meaning and guidance in your texts in any situation. Spend 10 minutes Deciphering Writing on religious scriptures of your deity or philosophy while thinking about a particular problem or conundrum you face, and then attempt a Religion check (DC determined by the GM). If you succeed, you unearth a relevant passage, parable, or aphorism that can help you move forward or change your thinking to help solve your conundrum.

DUBIOUS KNOWLEDGE			CATEGORY:Feat	TYPE:General.Skill	PREPCLEVEL:MIN=1		PREMULT:1,[PREVARGTEQ:Modifier_Arcana,1],[PREVARGTEQ:Modifier_Crafting,1],[PREVARGTEQ:Modifier_Lore,1],[PREVARGTEQ:Modifier_Medicine,1],[PREVARGTEQ:Modifier_Nature,1],[PREVARGTEQ:Modifier_Occultism,1],[PREVARGTEQ:Modifier_Religion,1],[PREVARGTEQ:Modifier_Society,1]				PRETEXT:Prerequisites trained in a skill with the Recall Knowledge action					DESC:You're a treasure trove of information, but not all of it comes from reputable sources. When you fail a Recall Knowledge check using any skill, you learn a bit of true knowledge and a bit of erroneous knowledge, but you don't have any way to differentiate which is which.

EXPEDITIOUS SEARCH		CATEGORY:Feat	TYPE:General		PREPCLEVEL:MIN=7		PREVARGTEQ:Modifier_Perception,3			PRETEXT:Prerequisites master in Perception										DESC:You have a system that lets you search at great speed, finding details and secrets twice as quickly as others can. When Searching, you take half as long as usual to Search a given area. This means that while exploring, you double the Speed you can move while ensuring you've Searched an area before walking into it (up to half your Speed).

EXPERIENCED PROFESSIONAL	CATEGORY:Feat	TYPE:General.Skill	PREPCLEVEL:MIN=1		PREVARGTEQ:Modifier_Lore,1			PRETEXT:Prerequisites trained in Lore											DESC:You carefully safeguard your professional endeavors to prevent disaster.

EXPERIENCED SMUGGLER		CATEGORY:Feat	TYPE:General.Skill	PREPCLEVEL:MIN=1		PREVARGTEQ:Modifier_Stealth,1			PRETEXT:Prerequisites trained in Stealth											DESC:You often smuggle things past the authorities. When the GM rolls your Stealth check to see if a passive observer notices a small item you have concealed, the GM uses the number rolled or 10—whichever is higher—as the result of your die roll, adding it to your Stealth modifier to determine your Stealth check result. If you're a master in Stealth, the GM uses the number rolled or 15, and if you're legendary in Stealth, you automatically succeed at hiding a small concealed item from passive observers. This provides no benefits when a creature attempts a Perception check while actively searching you for hidden items. Due to your smuggling skill, you're more likely to find more lucrative smuggling jobs when using Underworld Lore to Earn Income.

EXPERIENCED TRACKER		CATEGORY:Feat	TYPE:General.Skill	PREPCLEVEL:MIN=2		PREVARGTEQ:Modifier_Survival,1			PRETEXT:Prerequisites trained in Survival											DESC:Tracking is second nature to you, and when necessary you can follow a trail without pause. You can Track while moving at full Speed by taking a –5 penalty to your Survival check. If you're a master in Survival, you don't take the –5 penalty. If you're legendary in Survival, you no longer need to roll a new Survival check every hour when tracking, though you still need to roll whenever there are significant changes in the trail.

FASCINATING PERFORMANCE		CATEGORY:Feat	TYPE:General.Skill	PREPCLEVEL:MIN=1		PREVARGTEQ:Modifier_Performance,1			PRETEXT:Prerequisites trained in Performance										DESC:When you Perform, compare your result to the Will DC of one observer. If you succeed, the target is fascinated by you for 1 round. If the observer is in a situation that demands immediate attention, such as combat, you must critically succeed to fascinate it and the Perform action gains the incapacitation trait. You must choose which creature you're trying to fascinate before you roll your check, and the target is then temporarily immune for 1 hour.&nl;If you're an expert in Performance, you can fascinate up to four observers; if you're a master, you can fascinate up to 10 observers; and if you're legendary, you can fascinate any number of observers at the same time.

FAST RECOVERY			CATEGORY:Feat	TYPE:General	PREPCLEVEL:MIN=1		PRESTAT:1,CON=14			PRETEXT:Prerequisites Constitution 14											DESC:Your body quickly bounces back from afflictions. You regain twice as many Hit Points from resting. Each time you succeed at a Fortitude save against an ongoing disease or poison, you reduce its stage by 2, or by 1 against a virulent disease or poison. Each critical success you achieve against an ongoing disease or poison reduces its stage by 3, or by 2 against a virulent disease or poison. In addition, you reduce the severity of your drained condition by 2 when you rest for a night instead of by 1.

FEATHER STEP			CATEGORY:Feat	TYPE:General	PREPCLEVEL:MIN=1		PRESTAT:1,DEX=14			PRETEXT:Prerequisites Dexterity 14												DESC:You step carefully and quickly. You can Step into difficult terrain.

FLEET					CATEGORY:Feat	TYPE:General	PREPCLEVEL:MIN=1																				DESC:You move more quickly on foot. Your Speed increases by 5 feet.

FORAGER				CATEGORY:Feat	TYPE:General.Skill	PREPCLEVEL:MIN=1		PREVARGTEQ:Modifier_Survival,1			PRETEXT:Prerequisites trained in Survival											DESC:While using Survival to Subsist, if you roll any result worse than a success, you get a success. On a success, you can provide subsistence living for yourself and four additional creatures, and on a critical success, you can take care of twice as many creatures as on a success.&nl;Each time your proficiency rank in Survival increases, double the number of additional creatures you can take care of on a success (to eight if you're an expert, 16 if you're a master, or 32 if you're legendary). You can choose to care for half the number of additional creatures and provide a comfortable living instead of subsistence living.&nl;Multiple smaller creatures or creatures with significantly smaller appetites than a human are counted as a single creature for this feat, and larger creatures or those with significantly greater appetites each count as multiple creatures. The GM determines how much a non-human creature needs to eat.

GLAD-HAND				CATEGORY:Feat	TYPE:General.Skill	PREPCLEVEL:MIN=2		PREVARGTEQ:Modifier_Diplomacy,2			PRETEXT:Prerequisites expert in Diplomacy											DESC:First impressions are your strong suit. When you meet someone in a casual or social situation, you can immediately attempt a Diplomacy check to Make an Impression on that creature rather than needing to converse for 1 minute. You take a –5 penalty to the check. If you fail or critically fail, you can engage in 1 minute of conversation and attempt a new check at the end of that time rather than accepting the failure or critical failure result.

GROUP COERCION			CATEGORY:Feat	TYPE:General.Skill	PREPCLEVEL:MIN=1		PREVARGTEQ:Modifier_Intimidation,1			PRETEXT:Prerequisites trained in Intimidation										DESC:When you Coerce, you can compare your Intimidation check result to the Will DCs of two targets instead of one. It's possible to get a different degree of success for each target. The number of targets you can Coerce in a single action increases to four if you're an expert, 10 if you're a master, and 25 if you're legendary.

GROUP IMPRESSION			CATEGORY:Feat	TYPE:General.Skill	PREPCLEVEL:MIN=1		PREVARGTEQ:Modifier_Diplomacy,1			PRETEXT:Prerequisites trained in Diplomacy										DESC:When you Make an Impression, you can compare your Diplomacy check result to the Will DCs of two targets instead of one. It's possible to get a different degree of success for each target. The number of targets increases to four if you're an expert, 10 if you're a master, and 25 if you're legendary.

HEFTY HAULER			CATEGORY:Feat	TYPE:General.Skill		PREPCLEVEL:MIN=1		PREVARGTEQ:Modifier_Athletics,1			PRETEXT:Prerequisites trained in Athletics												DESC:You can carry more than your frame implies. Increase your maximum and encumbered Bulk limits by 2.		BONUS:VAR|BulkCap|2		BONUS:VAR|BulkEncumbered|2

HOBNOBBER				CATEGORY:Feat	TYPE:General.Skill	PREPCLEVEL:MIN=1		PREVARGTEQ:Modifier_Diplomacy,1			PRETEXT:Prerequisites trained in Diplomacy										DESC:You are skilled at learning information through conversation. The Gather Information exploration activity takes you half as long as normal (typically reducing the time to 1 hour). If you're a master in Diplomacy and you Gather Information at the normal speed, when you attempt to do so and roll a critical failure, you get a failure instead. There is still no guarantee that a rumor you learn with Gather Information is accurate.

IMPECCABLE CRAFTING			CATEGORY:Feat	TYPE:General.Skill	PREPCLEVEL:MIN=7		PREVARGTEQ:Modifier_Crafting,3		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Feat,SPECIALTY CRAFTING			PRETEXT:Prerequisites master in Crafting, Specialty Crafting							DESC:You craft flawless creations with great efficiency.

INTIMIDATING GLARE		CATEGORY:Feat	TYPE:General.Skill	PREPCLEVEL:MIN=1		PREVARGTEQ:Modifier_Intimidation,1			PRETEXT:Prerequisites trained in Intimidation										DESC:You can Demoralize with a mere glare. When you do, Demoralize loses the auditory trait and gains the visual trait, and you don't take a penalty if the creature doesn't understand your language.	

INTIMIDATING PROWESS		CATEGORY:Feat	TYPE:General.Skill	PREPCLEVEL:MIN=2		PREVARGTEQ:Modifier_Intimidation,2		PRESTAT:1,STR=16			PRETEXT:Prerequisites Strength 16, expert in Intimidation								DESC:In situations where you can physically menace the target when you Coerce or Demoralize, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your Intimidation check and you ignore the penalty for not sharing a language.

INVENTOR				CATEGORY:Feat	TYPE:Downtime.General.Skill	PREPCLEVEL:MIN=7		PREVARGTEQ:Modifier_Crafting,3			PRETEXT:Prerequisites master in Crafting											DESC:You are a genius at Crafting, easily able to determine how things are made and create new inventions. You can spend downtime to invent a common formula that you don't know. This works just like the Craft activity: you spend half the Price of the formula up front, attempt a Crafting check, and on a success either finish the formula by paying the difference or work for longer to decrease the Price. The difference is that you spend the additional time in research, design, and development, rather than in creating an item. Once it's complete, you add the new formula you invented to your formula book.

KIP UP				CATEGORY:Feat	TYPE:General.Skill	PREPCLEVEL:MIN=7		PREVARGTEQ:Modifier_Acrobatics,3			PRETEXT:Prerequisites master in Acrobatics										DESC:You stand up. This movement doesn't trigger reactions.

LEGENDARY CODEBREAKER		CATEGORY:Feat	TYPE:General.Skill	PREPCLEVEL:MIN=15		PREVARGTEQ:Modifier_Society,4			PRETEXT:Prerequisites legendary in Society										DESC:Your skill with languages and codes is so great that you can decipher information with little more than a quick read through a text. You can Decipher Writing using Society while reading at normal speed. If you slow down and spend the full amount of time that's ordinarily required and roll a success, you get a critical success; if you critically succeed while spending the normal amount of time, you gain a nearly word-for-word understanding of the document.

LEGENDARY LINGUIST		CATEGORY:Feat	TYPE:General.Skill	PREPCLEVEL:MIN=15		PREVARGTEQ:Modifier_Society,4		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Feat,MULTILINGUAL			PRETEXT:Prerequisites legendary in Society, Multilingual								DESC:You're so skilled with languages you can create a pidgin instantly. You can always talk to any creature that has a language—even a language you don't know— by creating a new pidgin language that uses simplified terms and conveys basic concepts. To do so, you must first understand at least what medium of communication the creature uses (speech, sign language, and so on).

LEGENDARY MEDIC			CATEGORY:Feat	TYPE:General.Skill	PREPCLEVEL:MIN=15		PREVARGTEQ:Modifier_Medicine,4			PRETEXT:Prerequisites legendary in Medicine										DESC:You've discovered medical breakthroughs or techniques that achieve miraculous results. Once per day for each target, you can spend 1 hour treating that target and attempt a Medicine check to remove a disease or the blinded, deafened, doomed, or drained condition. Use the DC of the disease or of the spell or effect that created the condition. If the effect's source is an artifact, above 20th level, or similarly powerful, increase the DC by 10.

LEGENDARY NEGOTIATION		CATEGORY:Feat	TYPE:General.Skill	PREPCLEVEL:MIN=15		PREVARGTEQ:Modifier_Diplomacy,4			PRETEXT:Prerequisites legendary in Diplomacy										DESC:You can negotiate incredibly quickly in adverse situations. You attempt to Make an Impression and then Request your opponent cease their current activity and engage in negotiations. You take a –5 penalty to your Diplomacy check. The GM sets the DC of the Request based on the circumstances—it's generally at least a very hard DC of the creature's level. Some creatures might simply refuse, and even those who agree to parley might ultimately find your arguments lacking and return to violence.

LEGENDARY PERFORMER		CATEGORY:Feat	TYPE:General.Skill	PREPCLEVEL:MIN=15		PREVARGTEQ:Modifier_Performance,4		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Feat,VIRTUOSIC PERFORMER			PRETEXT:Prerequisites legendary in Performance, Virtuosic Performer						DESC:Your fame has spread throughout the lands. NPCs who succeed at a DC 10 Society check to Recall Knowledge have heard of you and usually have an attitude toward you one step better than normal, depending on your reputation and the NPC's disposition. For instance, if you're well-known for cruel and demanding behavior, creatures might be intimidated by you, rather than be friendly toward you. When you Earn Income with Performance, you attract higher-level audiences than your location would allow, as audiences flock to see you. For instance, rulers and angels might travel to your small tower in the woods to hear you perform. Typically, this increases the audiences available by 2 levels or more, determined by the GM.

You can attempt to Steal something that is actively wielded or that would be extremely noticeable or time consuming to remove (like worn shoes or armor). You must do so slowly and carefully, spending at least 1 minute (and significantly longer for items that are normally time consuming to remove, like armor). Throughout this duration you must have some means of staying hidden, such as the cover of darkness or a bustling crowd. You take a –5 penalty to your Thievery check. Even if you succeed, if the item is extremely prominent—like a suit of full plate armor—onlookers will quickly notice it's gone after you steal it.

LENGTHY DIVERSION			CATEGORY:Feat	TYPE:General.Skill	PREPCLEVEL:MIN=1		PREVARGTEQ:Modifier_Deception,1			PRETEXT:Prerequisites trained in Deception											DESC:When you critically succeed to Create a Diversion, you continue to remain hidden after the end of your turn.

If you fail to learn the spell, you can try again after 1 week or after you gain a level, whichever comes first. If you're a master in the tradition's associated skill, learning a spell takes 5 minutes per spell level, and if you're legendary, it takes 1 minute per spell level. You can use downtime to learn and inscribe new spells. This works as if you were using Earn Income with the tradition's associated skill, but instead of gaining money, you choose a spell available to you to learn and gain a discount on learning it, learning it for free if your earned income equals or exceeds its cost.

The highest level of spell you automatically identify increases to 4 if you're an expert, 6 if you're a master, and 10 if you're legendary. The GM rolls a secret Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion check, whichever corresponds to the tradition of the spell being cast.

The GM determines the DC of any check required and the amount of time the training takes (usually at least a week). It's usually impossible to teach an animal a trick that uses critical thinking.

The relevant skills are Arcana for arcane, Nature for primal, Occultism for occult, Religion for divine, or any of the four for an item that has the magical trait and not a tradition trait. The GM determines the DC based on the item's level (possibly adjusted depending on the item or situation).&nl;If you activate a magic item that requires a spell attack roll or spell DC and you don't have the ability to cast spells of the relevant tradition, use your level as your proficiency bonus and the highest of your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifiers. If you're a master in the appropriate skill for the item's tradition, you instead use the trained proficiency bonus, and if you're legendary, you instead use the expert proficiency bonus. &nl; - Success For the rest of the current turn, you can spend actions to activate the item as if you could normally use it. &nl; - Failure You can't use the item or try to trick it again this turn, but you can try again on subsequent turns. &nl; - Critical Failure You can't use the item, and you can't try to trick it again until your next daily preparations.
