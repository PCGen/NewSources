###Block: New Spells
# 46
BANISH LIGHT
School abjuration [darkness]; Level antipaladin 4, cleric
7, nightblade 6, sorcerer/wizard 7
Casting Time 1 standard action
Components V, S
Range 30 ft.
Area 30 ft.-radius emanation, centered on you
Duration 10 min./level (D)
Saving Throw none; Spell Resistance no
A field of pure darkness emanates from you and follows
you, removing all light within the area. The lighting
within the spell’s area becomes supernatural darkness,
as a deeper darkness spell, regardless of existing lighting
conditions. All non-magical light sources in the area are
snuffed out. Supernatural abilities that create light or fire
and spells with the light or fire descriptor are suppressed
within the area of the spell, as an antimagic field. Positive
energy effects in the area deal only half their normal
damage to undead creatures and heal half their normal
hit points to living creatures.
Banish light can be used to counter or dispel a spell
with the fire or light descriptor of any level, even those
with a higher level than banish light.
BANISH SHADOWS
School abjuration [light]; Level cleric 7, nightblade 6,
paladin 4, sorcerer/wizard 7
Casting Time 1 standard action
Components V, S
Range 30 ft.
Area 30 ft.-radius emanation, centered on you
Duration 10 min./level (D)
Saving Throw none; Spell Resistance no
A field of brilliant light emanates from you and
follows you, removing all darkness within the area. The
lighting within the spell’s area becomes bright light, as a
daylight spell, regardless of existing lighting conditions.
Supernatural abilities that create darkness, spells with the
darkness or shadow descriptor, and spells of the shadow
subschool are suppressed within the area of the spell, as
an antimagic field. Creatures within the area of the spell do
not cast a shadow. If an object or creature is hidden away
within a creature’s shadow, such as a nightblade’s shadow
bond ability or an object hidden by a shadow courier spell,
the hidden object or creature cannot be accessed or
utilized while in the area of this spell. Negative energy
effects in the area deal only half their normal damage to
living creatures and heal half their normal hit points to
undead creatures.

# 47
Banish shadows can be used to counter or dispel a spell
of the shadow subschool or a spell with the shadow
or darkness descriptor of any level, even those with a
higher level than banish shadows.
CONTROL LIGHT
School evocation [darkness, light]; Level cleric 4, druid
4, shaman 4
Casting Time 1 standard action
Components V, S, M (a pearl and a piece of obsidian,
each worth at least 10 gp)
Range 60 ft.
Area 60-ft. radius centered on you
Duration 10 min./level (D)
Saving Throw none; Spell Resistance no
As you cast this spell, the gem that you hold in each
hand dissolves away, the pearl staining one hand with
a silvery glow, the obsidian blackening your other hand
with darkness. Upon casting this spell, you designate
the light level that you wish to maintain (bright light,
normal light, dim light, or darkness). The lighting within
60 feet of you is changed to that light level, regardless
of existing conditions. By concentrating on the spell (a
standard action) you can change the lightning level this
spell creates by one step in either direction.
Nonmagical sources of light or shadows do not have
any effect within the area of this spell. Any magical
source of light or darkness that would alter the lighting
to a different light level than you have designated has a
chance of being suppressed. You must make an opposed
caster level check against the caster of the other source
of light or darkness. Success means the other source of
light or darkness has no effect inside the area of this
spell for the remaining duration of this spell, even if the
area of light or darkness is brought outside the area of
this spell and later brought back in. Failure means the
other spell’s effects supersede the lighting or darkness
created by control light for the duration of the spell.
Control light counters or dispels any light or darkness
spell of the same level or lower, such as daylight or snuff.
CURSE OF THE LIGHTLESS
School necromancy [curse, darkness]; Level cleric 5,
nightblade 5, sorcerer/wizard 6, witch 6
Casting Time 1 standard action
Components V, S, F (a broken mirror)
Range touch
Target creature touched
Duration permanent
Saving Throw Will partial; Spell Resistance yes
With a touch you curse your foe to a life of exile and
darkness. Upon failing its saving throw, the creature’s
shadow immediately and permanently vanishes. Any
spells that utilize its shadow, such as shadow courier or
shadow wound, are dispelled and cannot be used on the
target as long as the curse persists. Creatures with the
shadow surge class feature lose any shadow surges they
currently have and cannot gain shadow surges as long
as they are cursed. Any object or creature hidden in the
creature’s shadow, such as from a nightblade’s shadow
bond ability, is expelled and appears in an adjacent
space to the creature. Exposing the target to bright light
staggers it so long as it remains in the light. The creature
is also treated as an undead creature for determining the
damage of spells that deal additional damage to undead,
such as wall of fire or sunburst. This does not grant the
creature the ability to be healed by negative energy, nor
is it harmed by positive energy (unless it already was
beforehand).
Twenty-four hours after the curse is bestowed, the
creature’s weakness to bright light becomes lethal. From
then on, exposing the creature to direct sunlight staggers
it on the first round of exposure and destroys it utterly
on the second consecutive round of exposure if it does
not escape, similar to a vampire. This is in addition to the
previously described penalties the curse brings.
A creature that makes its Will save is staggered for 1
round if it is in bright light, but suffers no further effects.
The curse bestowed by this spell cannot be dispelled, but
it can be removed with a break enchantment, limited wish,
miracle, remove curse, or wish spell.
While a creature can learn to live with the curse, in
lands where vampires are a threat or feared, the curse
can make the creature the subject of superstition or
outright hostility from others.
DARK CONFINEMENT
School illusion (shadow) [darkness, shadow]; Level
antipaladin 2, inquisitor 2, nightblade 2, sorcerer/
wizard 2, witch 2
Casting Time 1 standard action
Components V, S, M (a spider web)
Range close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
Target one creature per level, no two of which can be
more than 30 ft. apart
Duration 1 round/level
Saving Throw Will negates; Spell Resistance yes
Each creature targeted by this spell finds itself unable
to enter well-lit areas. As long as dark confinement persists,
affected creatures must remain within areas of dim light,
darkness, or supernatural darkness and cannot willingly
enter into areas of normal light or bright light; attempts
to do so feel as if struggling against a solid wall. This
spell has no effect on creatures that are not in an area of
dim light, darkness, or supernatural darkness at the time
of casting. If an affected creature is forcefully moved
into an area of normal or bright light (such as by a bull
rush maneuver), or if the space containing the creature

# 48
is brought to normal light or brighter, the spell is
suppressed for that creature until it moves back into an
area of dim light or darker, at which point the effects of
dark confinement resume (assuming the spell has duration
remaining). A creature is not compelled to move back
into darker areas if moved in such a manner.
DARK RECOVERY
School evocation [darkness]; Level nightblade 2
Casting Time 1 swift action
Components V
Range personal
Target you
Duration instantaneous
Saving Throw none; Spell Resistance no
With a hushed whisper, you gather the power of
shadows around you, granting yourself a shadow surge.
You must be able to use shadow surges to cast this spell
and must be below your maximum number of shadow
surges at the time of casting.
DEATHWINGS
School necromancy [darkness]; Level cleric 6, nightblade
5, sorcerer/wizard 5, witch 6
Casting Time 1 standard action
Components V, S, M (a raven’s feather)
Range touch
Target creature touched
Duration 10 min./level
Saving Throw Will negates (harmless), Will half, see
text; Spell Resistance yes (harmless)
The creature you touch sprouts wings made of shadows
and negative energy. This grants the creature a fly speed
of 60 feet with good maneuverability, as a fly spell.
The wings can be used to attack. The two wings are
secondary natural attacks, dealing 1d4 points of damage
(for a medium creature) plus half the creature’s Strength
bonus. The wings also inflict negative energy damage
equal to 1d6 + 1 per two caster levels (maximum +10)
on a successful hit.
At any point during the spell’s duration, the recipient
of the spell can release the negative energy in the wings
in a single burst. This functions as a cleric channeling
negative energy, using your caster level as cleric levels
to determine the damage the channeled energy deals (or
the amount it heals undead, should the creature use it
in that manner). The DC of the Will save to take half
damage is equal to the DC of deathwings. Upon using the
deathwings to channel negative energy, the spell ends; if
the creature is in the air when this occurs, it falls to the
ground slowly, as a fly spell does.
ENTROPIC STORM
School necromancy; Level cleric 9, sorcerer/wizard 9
Casting Time 1 standard action
Components V, S
Range medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
Area 30-ft. radius spread
Duration concentration, up to 1 round/level, see text
Saving Throw Fortitude partial, see text; Spell
Resistance yes

# 49
You create a gateway to the destructive void between the
Plane of Shadows and the Plane of Negative Energy,
exposing those within to entropic oblivion.
Creatures in the area age a single age category (no
save). The creature immediately takes the age penalties
to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution for its new
age category, but does not gain the bonuses for that
category. Each round the creature remains in the area,
it ages yet another age category, going from middle age
to old, and old to venerable. The penalties from aging
are cumulative, just as with normal aging. A creature
that ages to venerable age (or is already venerable) that
is exposed to the entropic storm must make a Fortitude
save or age so far that it simply stops existing, slaying
it and reducing its entire being to dust. This is a death
effect. It must make this save each round it is exposed to
the storm. A creature reduced to dust in this manner can
only be revived via miracle, wish, or true resurrection. After
leaving the area of the entropic storm, a living creature
goes back down age categories at a rate of one age
category per hour until it is restored to its original age.
Unattended objects, constructs, or undead creatures
in the area age and decay rapidly, taking 5d6 points of
damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +20) each
round they remain in the area (no save). A magic item
destroyed loses its magical functions as normal and
falls into a state of significant disrepair, but is otherwise
intact and can be repaired by a make whole spell. Mundane
objects that lose all of their hit points are reduced to
dust and cannot be restored.
A creature whose age is unknown starts by aging
to middle age, from which it can continue to age if
continuously exposed to the entropic storm. Ageless or
immortal creatures are immune to this spell. Nightshades,
being made of pure entropy, are also immune to this
spell’s effects. This spell cannot destroy artifacts, though
it can damage them.
As part of concentrating on the spell, you can move
the area of the entropic storm 10 feet in any direction.
EYES OF EVENTIDE
School transmutation; Level inquisitor 1, nightblade 1,
sorcerer/wizard 1
Casting Time 1 standard action
Components V, S
Range touch
Target creature touched
Duration 1 hour/level
Saving Throw Will negates (harmless); Spell
Resistance yes (harmless)
This spell enhances the vision of a creature, granting
it low-light vision for the duration of the spell. The
creature also gains a +2 insight bonus on saving throws
against effects that would cause it to be dazzled or
blinded. Creatures that already have low-light vision do
not have their vision enhanced further, but still receive
the bonus on saving throws.
EYES OF EVENTIDE, COMMUNAL
School transmutation; Level inquisitor 2, nightblade 2,
sorcerer/wizard 2
Target creatures touched
This spell functions like eyes of eventide, except you
may divide the duration in 1-hour intervals among the
creatures touched.
GRASP OF DARKNESS
School evocation [darkness]; Level bloodrager 1, magus
1, nightblade 1, sorcerer/wizard 1
Casting Time 1 standard action
Components V, S
Range touch
Target creature or object touched
Duration instantaneous
Saving Throw Fortitude partial; Spell Resistance yes
You reach out with a hand of chilling shadows, dealing
1d6 cold damage per caster level (maximum 5d6) on a
successful melee touch attack. A creature struck must
make a Fortitude save or have its vision clouded with
shadows, making it treat all other creatures if they had
concealment (20% miss chance) for 1 round. A creature
that does not use vision to see or has the see in darkness
ability is not subjected to the concealment effect.
HIDDEN ILLUMINATION
School evocation [darkness, light]; Level bard 1, cleric
1, inquisitor 1, nightblade 1, sorcerer/wizard 1,
summoner 1, witch 1
Casting Time 1 standard action
Components V, S
Range touch
Target creature or object touched
Duration 10 min./level
Saving Throw none; Spell Resistance no
You create a field of special energy to a radius of 30
feet around the touched creature or object that enhances
low-light vision and darkvision of creatures in the area.
Creatures with low-light vision can see double the
distance they normally can in dim light (letting them see
four times as far as a human can in dim light). Creatures
with darkvision in the area are able to perceive color and
detail of things in the area, rather than seeing them in
black and white. This spell does not create a visible light
source, nor does it alter the lighting level in the area in
any way.
Hidden illumination counters or dispels any light or
darkness spell of the same level or lower, such as flare
burst or snuff.
# 50
ILLUSORY EDGE
School illusion (shadow) [shadow]; Level sorcerer/
wizard 4
Casting Time 1 standard action
Components V, S
Range close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
Target one weapon or 50 projectiles (all of which must
be together at the time of casting)
Duration 1 min./level
Saving Throw Will negates (harmless, object), Will
disbelief, see text; Spell Resistance yes (harmless,
object)
You use shadow magic to create an illusory enchantment
on a weapon. This functions as the spell greater magic
weapon, except the enhancement is only partially real
and you can grant different properties. In place of
the enhancement bonuses, you can grant any of the
following weapon special properties (as appropriate for
the weapon): designating, exhausting, greater designating, frost,
icy burst, impact, keen, ghost touch, seeking, wounding. Adding
these properties consumes an amount of bonus equal
to the property’s base price modifier. These properties
are added to any the weapon already has, but duplicates
do not stack. If the weapon is not magical, at least a
+1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other
properties can be added.
A creature struck by a weapon enhanced by illusory edge
is entitled to a Will save to disbelieve the enhancements.
A successful save makes any special properties granted
by illusory edge (such as frost or keen) not function on that
creature. Regular enhancement bonuses continue to
work as normal against that creature, as do any special
properties that were already on the weapon.
ILLUSORY STRIKE
School illusion (shadow); Level bard 4, nightblade 4,
sorcerer/wizard 4
Casting Time 1 standard action
Components V, S
Range medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
Target one illusion (figment) spell you control, see text
Duration instantaneous
Saving Throw See text; Spell Resistance yes
With a quick incantation you blend your illusions with
shadowstuff from the Plane of Shadow, making an
illusion reality for a short time. When you cast the spell,
you designate a single illusion (figment) spell you can see
and currently control or are maintaining concentration
on. That illusion becomes real for a short time, allowing
it to harm other creatures.
Depending on the form of the illusion, the illusion
can make different kinds of attacks. The possible attacks
are shown on Table: Illusory Strike. You may choose
a single attack form from the table that is appropriate
for the illusion to use (along with a damage type for that
attack form), subject to GM discretion. For example, an
illusory dragon might use the Area Energy Attack option
to simulate the dragon’s breath attack, or use the Melee
Attack option to simulate the dragon clawing and biting
its opponent. If the effect calls for a saving throw, it uses
the DC of this spell to determine the saving throw. If
the illusion attacks a creature that has spell resistance,
you must make a caster level check as normal to bypass
it; failure means that creature is unaffected by this spell.
If a creature has already disbelieved the illusion that
illusory strike targets, that creature gains a +2 bonus to
AC and to saves against this spell’s effects.
# 51
If you cast this spell and target a figment that you
must maintain concentration on (such as silent image),
you do not have to concentrate to maintain the spell this
round.
ILLUSORY VESTMENT
School illusion (shadow) [shadow]; Level sorcerer/
wizard 4
Casting Time 1 standard action
Components V, S
Range close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
Target one suit of armor or a shield
Duration 1 min./level
Saving Throw Will negates (harmless, object), Will
disbelief, see text; Spell Resistance yes (harmless,
object)
You use shadow magic to create an illusory enchantment
on a suit of armor or a shield. This functions as the
spell magic vestment, except the enhancement is only
partially real and you can grant different properties. In
place of the enhancement bonuses, you can grant any of
the following armor special properties: deathless, defiant,
fortification (any), ghost touch, invulnerability, spell resistance
(any). Adding these properties consumes an amount of
bonus equal to the property’s base price modifier. These
properties are added to any the equipment already has,
but duplicates do not stack. If the armor or shield is not
magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added
before any other properties can be added.
When a creature attacks a creature that is using the
equipment enhanced by illusory vestment in any way
(such as with an attack, spell, or combat maneuver),
that creature is entitled to a Will save to disbelieve the
enhancements. This save is done before the attack roll
(if any) is made. A successful save makes any special
properties granted by illusory vestment (such as fortification
or spell resistance) not function against attacks made by
that creature. Regular enhancement bonuses continue to
work as normal against that creature, as do any special
properties that were already on the armor or shield.
LUNAR PROPHECY
School divination; Level druid 5, shaman 5, witch 5
Casting Time 10 minutes, see text
Components V, S, M/DF (a calm pool of water at least
1 foot in diameter plus incense and herbs worth 50 gp)
Range touch
Target one creature per two caster levels
Duration 24 hours
Saving Throw see text; Spell Resistance no
With this spell, you seek guidance from the moon to
best prepare your allies for what lies ahead. All creatures
that wish to partake in the spell must remain within 10
feet of you while you are casting the spell. The spell
must be cast at night in the open, so that you can see
the reflection of the moon within the pool of water. If
weather conditions prevent you from seeing the moon,
you may still cast the spell, but the casting time increases
to 1 hour as the spell forces the sky to clear. This only
clears enough of the sky for you to receive the prophecy
and has no long-term effect on the weather.
Upon finishing the spell, the image of the moon that
shines upon the pool of water changes to any of its
eight phases. The phase of the actual moon does not

# 52
change. The phase of the moon that the reflection shows
determines the ability that is granted to the participants
of the spell. Roll 1d8 to determine what phase of the
moon is shown, and what ability it grants, as shown on
Table: Lunar Prophecy. The ability can be used once
by each target within the 24 hour duration of the spell.
Rather than roll randomly, you can attempt to force
a specific prophecy. To do so, you must make a Will
save against your own spell. Should you succeed, you
can choose which result on Table: Lunar Prophecy is
shown to you and grant the chosen effect on the targets
of the spell. If you fail the saving throw, the reflection
in the water appears clouded over, and the spell fails. A
creature that took part of a failed lunar prophecy cannot
be the recipient the spell for 24 hours from any source.
A creature can only benefit from a single lunar prophecy
at a time. Should another lunar prophecy be cast on that
creature before the previous duration has ended, the
spell fails.
MAW OF THE NIGHTWAVE
School conjuration [darkness]; Level sorcerer/wizard 8,
witch 8
Casting Time 1 standard action
Components V, S, M (a shark’s tooth, plus a polished
onyx stone worth at least 50 gp)
Range close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
Effect mouth that takes up a 20-ft. cube of space
Duration 1 round/4 levels
Saving Throw Fortitude partial, see text; Spell
Resistance yes
Upon finishing this spell, the front half of a shadowy,
shark-like creature appears where you specify in range,
its maw a gnashing void of death. The form belongs
to none other than the nightwave, the strongest known
form of the undead monstrosities known as nightshades.
The maw has a space of 20 feet and a reach of 20
feet. The maw can be conjured in another creature’s
space. Upon casting the spell and each round afterwards
on your turn for the duration, the maw can make a
single attack on a creature within its space or within its
reach. The maw uses your caster level in place of its
base attack bonus, with a +19 Strength bonus (it has
49 Strength) and a -4 size penalty for being gargantuan.
On a successful bite, the victim takes 5d10+19 piercing
damage, 4d6 cold damage, and gains a negative level.
Twenty-four hours after gaining any negative levels, the
subject must make a Fortitude saving throw (DC = maw
of the nightwave’s spell’s save DC) for each negative level.
If the save succeeds, that negative level is removed. If it
fails, that negative level becomes permanent.
The maw has the grab and swallow whole universal
monster abilities, allowing it to grapple a creature that
it bites as a free action and eventually swallow it. It is
able to grab a creature of any size up to colossal, but
cannot swallow whole a colossal creature. The maw gets
a +4 bonus on grapple checks (from having the grab
ability), a +4 size bonus, and has a Dexterity of 16. A
creature swallowed whole by the maw takes 5d10+28
bludgeoning damage each round and gains a negative
level, as described above. A creature can cut its way out
of the maw; the maw’s insides has an AC of 25 and 40
hit points. If a creature manages to cut its way out of the
maw, the spell ends.
NEGATIVE IMAGE
School evocation [darkness, light]; Level bard 4,
nightblade 4, sorcerer/wizard 4, witch 4
Casting Time 1 standard action
Components V, S, F (a mirror)
Range touch
Target object touched
Duration 10 min./level (D)
Saving Throw none; Spell Resistance no
You touch an object when you cast this spell, causing
it to emit an aura that reverses lighting conditions in a
60-foot radius around itself. Areas that were originally
dim light become normal light, while areas that were
normal light become dim light. Areas of darkness or
supernatural darkness become bright light, and areas
of bright light become darkness. A source of light or
darkness (magical or non-magical) brought into the area
have their effects similarly reversed. This spell has no
effect on spells with the light or darkness descriptor that
are instantaneous, such as sunburst or flare.
Negative image counters or dispels any light or darkness
spell of the same level or lower, such as daylight or snuff.
NIGHT ARMOR
School illusion (shadow) [shadow]; Level alchemist 4,
bloodrager 4, magus 4, nightblade 4, sorcerer/wizard 4
Casting Time 1 standard action
Components V, S
Range personal
Target you
Duration 1 min./level
Your shadow flows up and surrounds you, defending you
from incoming attacks. The night armor reduces incoming
damage, granting you DR 5/silver for the duration of
the spell, as well as the benefits of a night shield spell.
In addition to these benefits, the shadow can deflect a
single ranged touch attack each round. This functions
similarly to the Ray ShieldAPG feat, though you do not
need to be wearing a shield to deflect the attack (the
night armor does it for you). This deflected ranged touch
attack is in addition to the one ranged touch attack you
can deflect each round with the Ray ShieldAPG feat, if
you have it normally.

# 53
Once the night armor has prevented 10 points of
damage per caster level (maximum 150), the spell is
discharged. This includes both the damage prevented by
the damage reduction and the damage that would have
been dealt by ray attacks deflected by the night armor, but
does not include deflected ranged weapon attacks with
the Missile ShieldAPG ability nor any magic missile spells
blocked by the night armor.
NIGHT SHIELD
School illusion (shadow) [shadow]; Level alchemist 2,
bloodrager 2, magus 2, nightblade 2, sorcerer/wizard 2
Casting Time 1 standard action
Components V, S
Range personal
Target you
Duration 1 min./level
Your shadow flows up as a swirling barrier, moving to
intercept long-range attacks. The night shield protects
you from magic missile spells, as a shield spell. In addition,
the shadow deflects a single ranged weapon attack each
round. This functions similarly to the Missile ShieldAPG
feat, though you do not need to be wearing a shield to
deflect the attack (the night shield does it for you). This
deflected attack is in addition to the one ranged attack
you can deflect each round with the Missile ShieldAPG
feat, if you have it normally. The same limitations of
Missile ShieldAPG, such as being unable to deflect siege
weapons or natural attacks, applies to the night shield.
NIGHT TERROR
School enchantment [emotion, fear, mind-affecting];
Level antipaladin 3, inquisitor 3, nightblade 3,
sorcerer/wizard 3, witch 3
Casting Time 1 standard action
Components V, S
Range close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
Target one creature per level
Duration 1 round/level
Saving Throw Will negates; Spell Resistance yes
With a single word you evoke the primal fear of darkness
in your foes. You do not need line of sight to creatures
you affect with this spell, but must have line of effect to
each creature. Each creature you target within range must
make a Will save or become terrified of darkness for the
duration of the spell. An affected creature is shaken as
long as it remains in dim light, or frightened so long as
it remains within darkness or supernatural darkness. A
creature that leaves from darker lighting conditions and
reenters becomes shaken or frightened as appropriate so
long as the spell still has duration remaining.
Creatures with darkvision or the see in darkness
ability are still subjected to this spell’s effects, but gain a
+2 bonus on the saving throw.
PHANTASMAL FOE
School illusion (phantasm) [mind-affecting]; Level
magus 2, nightblade 2, sorcerer/wizard 3
Casting Time 1 standard action
Components V, S
Range close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
Target one creature
Duration 1 round/2 levels
Saving Throw Will negates; Spell Resistance yes
You create an illusory foe in your opponent’s mind that
hounds them in combat. On a failed save, the target
sees an enemy that threatens it in melee combat, always
moving with your allies to surround it. The target is
always treated as being flanked by any creature that
threatens it for the duration of the spell. The phantasmal
foe cannot actually harm the creature or affect it in any
way aside from allowing real creatures to flank easily.
The target recognizes the phantasmal foe as an enemy,
but it does not take the form of an enemy that could
incite a particularly strong emotional response, such as
appearing as a creature the target is specifically afraid of.

# 54
PHANTASMAL POLYMORPH
School illusion (phantasm) [mind-affecting]; Level
nightblade 6, sorcerer/wizard 6
Casting Time 1 standard action
Components V, S
Range close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
Target one creature
Duration 1 minute/level; see text
Saving Throw Will negates, see text; Spell Resistance
yes
With an invocation of jumbled words, you make a
creature feel as though it has taken on a different
form, while in reality the creature has not changed. If
the target fails its Will save, it believes that it has been
polymorphed into a different creature or an object, as
the spell polymorph any object. You choose what creature
or object the target believes it has turned into when you
cast the spell. The target believes this entirely, acting and
reacting to stimuli as if it were the chosen creature. If
it is turned into an object, the creature lies still and is
considered helpless.
The creature perceives itself and events as if it were
the creature, including any sounds or motions it makes
or its own tactile qualities; for example, a human that
believes it has been turned into a goblin will see its own
reflection as a goblin and feel its own shape as if it were
a goblin, even though to outside viewers the target has
not changed physically in any way. It does not gain any
extraordinary, spell-like, or supernatural abilities of
the new form and cannot use its own special abilities
unless it could reasonably believe it could do so (such
as a natural weapon shared by both forms), though it
retains any special qualities the creature originally had
that required no action on its part to use, such as fast
healing, damage reduction, or a protective aura.
Each time an outside force causes something that
is contradictory to the target’s belief in its new form,
the target can make an additional saving throw to end
the effect. This contradiction must be significant. For
example, a huge creature may be made to believe it has
been transformed into a small creature; this itself is
not significant enough, but if the creature attempts to
flee through a normal-sized doorway and finds that it
cannot fit (due to its actual body still being huge) it gets
an additional saving throw. A living creature that believes
it has been turned into an object is always considered
to be a significant enough contradiction to allow this
saving throw. A creature cannot make additional saves
more than once per round, regardless of the number of
stimuli it experiences.
PHANTOM CARETAKER
School conjuration (creation); Level cleric 2, inquisitor
2, paladin 2
Casting Time 1 minute
Components V, S, F (a doctor’s mask worth 50 gp)
Range 0 ft.
Effect one quasi-real doctor
Duration 24 hours (D)
Saving Throw none; Spell Resistance no
As you finish casting the spell, the doctor’s mask floats
away from your grasp. A faint image of a person in
doctor’s attire appears next to you, donning the mask
before fully materializing into a person.
Originally created by overstressed clerics during times
of war, this spell summons a quasi-real doctor that can
heal and attend to patients. The caretaker appears in an
open space adjacent to you. Its physical shape and size is
no different than a typical member of your race, though
its entire form is covered in doctor’s clothing, including
the mask used as the focus for this spell.
The caretaker has a Heal skill bonus equal to your
own Heal skill bonus or your caster level + your casting
modifier (Wisdom for clerics and inquisitors, Charisma
for oracles and paladins), whichever is higher. It can
perform any task that can be accomplished by a Heal
check, including long-term care, treating poisons and
diseases, and so forth. The caretaker is not summoned
with a healer’s kit, so should you ask it to treat deadly
wounds it will take penalties to the check unless you
provide a kit for the caretaker to use. It can understand,
speak, and write any languages that you know. The
caretaker works tirelessly for the 24 hours the spell lasts
and suffers no penalties for lack of sleep.
The caretaker has a movement speed of 30 feet and
moves as you ask it to; if brought onto the battlefield, it
will attempt to stay out of harm’s way until it is asked to
tend to an injured creature, at which point it will move
in the safest way possible to that creature. The caretaker
has a Strength score of 12 in order to help lift or drag
a willing, injured creature; it is incapable of taking any
hostile actions or attacking. It has an AC of 15 and 20 hit
points. If reduced to 0 hit points, the spell ends.
SENSORY DEPRIVATION
School transmutation; Level cleric 4, inquisitor 3,
nightblade 3, sorcerer/wizard 3, witch 3
Casting Time 1 standard action
Components V, S
Range medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
Target one creature
Duration 1 minute/level
Saving Throw Will negates; Spell Resistance yes
This spell suppresses a creature’s extraordinary senses.
For the duration of the spell, the creature loses the
following abilities (if it has them): all-around vision,
blindsense, blindsight, darkvision, low-light vision,
scent, and tremorsense. If these abilities are granted

# 55
by a spell or magical effect, the effect is suppressed for
the duration of sensory deprivation (this duration counts
against the suppressed spell’s duration). This does not
affect a creature’s basic senses; the creature can still
see, hear, smell, and so on, assuming it has the proper
sensory organs (a creature that relies on blindsight and
has no eyes, for example, is effectively blinded).
SENSORY DEPRIVATION, GREATER
School transmutation; Level cleric 7, inquisitor 6,
nightblade 6, sorcerer/wizard 6, witch 6
This spell functions as sensory deprivation, but also
suppresses a creature’s supernatural and magical
senses. This includes the following abilities: darksense,
greensight, lifesense, see in darkness, spiritsense,
divination spells, or any magic item or ability that
replicates a spell of the divination school. Creature
abilities that replicate divination effects are only
suppressed if they are listed as “senses” in the creature’s
stat block; for example, an archon’s detect evil would be
negated, but not its truespeech.
SHADOW AMMUNITION
School illusion (shadow) [shadow]; Level nightblade 1,
sorcerer/wizard 1, witch 1
Casting Time 1 standard action
Components V, S
Range 0 ft.
Effect 50 pieces of shadow ammunition
Duration 1 minute/level
Saving Throw Will disbelief (if interacted with); Spell
Resistance yes
Drawing upon the Plane of Shadow, you create a stock
of 50 pieces of shadowy masterwork ammunition for a
ranged weapon you are proficient with. This can create
regular ammunition for the weapon you use, such as a
crossbow bolt, shuriken, firearm bullet, or arrow, but not
any special form of ammunition such as a smoke arrow
or an alchemical cartridge. You may use this ammunition
to make attacks as if it were real ammunition, dealing
normal damage for its type (based on the weapon it
is used for). The first time you hit a creature with the
weapon, it may make a Will save to disbelieve; failure
means the ammunition deals damage normally, success
means it only takes 1 point of damage from attacks made
with that ammunition (including any further attacks you
make with the ammunition). The ammunition only deals
1 point of damage to objects.
If an attacked creature has spell resistance, you make
a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against that
spell resistance the first time the shadow ammunition
strikes it. If the ammunition is successfully resisted, the
spell is dispelled. If not, the target may save to disbelieve
as normal.
At 5th level, the ammunition gains a +1 enhancement
bonus. At 10th-level, you may increase the enhancement
bonus to +2 or add the frost or seeking weapon property.
The frost and seeking properties have no effect if the
target makes its disbelief save.
Any ammunition that leaves your possession by any
means other than firing them from a weapon you are
using is destroyed. Ammunition that is fired is destroyed
after the attack resolves. Once all ammunition is used,
the spell ends.
SHADOW BALL
School evocation [darkness]; Level magus 2, nightblade
2, sorcerer/wizard 2, witch 2
Casting Time 1 standard action
Components V, S, M (a drop of ink and some tar)
Range medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
Effect 5-ft.-diameter sphere
Duration 1 round/level
Saving Throw Reflex negates; Spell Resistance yes
A shifting ball of darkness flies in whichever direction
you point and deals cold damage to those it strikes. It
has a fly speed of 20 feet with perfect maneuverability.
If it enters a space that contains a creature, the ball
stops moving for the round and deals 3d6 points of
cold damage to that creature, though a successful Reflex
save negates the damage. The area within 5 feet of the
shadow ball has the light level lowered by one step (from
bright light to normal light, and from normal light to dim
light), though this cannot lower the lighting conditions
below dim light.
The ball moves as long as you actively direct it (a
move action for you); otherwise, it merely stays at rest.
The ball has no physical substance and cannot exert any
force on corporeal creatures or objects. It disperses if it
exceeds the spell’s range.
SHADOW BALL, GREATER
School evocation [darkness]; Level magus 4, nightblade
4, sorcerer/wizard 4, witch 4
This spell functions as shadow ball, except it deals 6d6
points of cold damage to any creature it strikes. Any
creature that fails its save against the ball is coated in
shadows, making it treat all other creatures as if they had
total concealment (50% miss chance) for 1d4 rounds. A
creature that does not use vision to see or has the see
in darkness ability is not affected by the concealment
effect.
SHADOW BINDING
School illusion (shadow) [shadow]; Level nightblade 2,
sorcerer/wizard 2
Casting Time 1 standard action
Components V, S

# 56
Range short (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
Target one creature
Duration 1 round/level
Saving Throw Will negates, Will partial, see text; Spell
Resistance yes
You cause a creature’s shadow to animate and restrict the
creature, the shadow becoming a semi-real aggressor. A
creature that fails its Will save has its shadow stretch
along its body like a sheet to bind the creature, making
it entangled (though it is not anchored and can still
move at half speed). In addition to the normal penalties
imparted by being entangled, the shadow restricts the
creature’s attacks even further. Any time the creature
attempts to attack, the creature must make another Will
save or have the attack automatically miss, its movement
hindered too much by the shadow to strike at its target.
The shadow can only stop one attack each round,
regardless of how many attacks the creature can make.
A creature in bright light gains a +2 bonus on its
saving throw against this spells effects, including the
Will saves made to make attacks unhindered. A creature
cannot be targeted this spell if it does not cast a shadow,
such as by being a vampire or being under a curse of the
lightless spell.
SHADOW BINDING, MASS
School illusion (shadow) [shadow]; Level nightblade 6,
sorcerer/wizard 6
Target one creature/level, no two of which can be more
than 30 ft. apart
This spell functions as shadow binding, except as noted
above. In addition, the shadow is capable of stopping
any number of attacks each round, rather than just one
attack per round. Creatures must make a saving throw
for each attack.
SHADOW BLAST
School evocation [cold, darkness, electricity]; Level
magus 6, nightblade 6, sorcerer/wizard 6
Casting Time 1 standard action
Components V, S
Range 60 ft.
Area 60 ft. cone-shaped burst
Duration instantaneous
Saving Throw Reflex half; Spell Resistance yes
This spell creates a destructive blast of shadows,
lightning, and ice from your outstretched hand, drawing
upon the Plane of Shadow to create a twisted replica
of a fearsome thunderstorm. Any creature caught in
the area of the shadow blast must make a Reflex save
or take 1d6 damage per caster level (max 20d6). Half
this damage is cold damage, the other half is electricity
damage. Creatures that fail their Reflex saves are blinded
for 1 round by the shadowy energies.

# 57
SHADOW CONJURATION, LESSER
School illusion (shadow) [shadow]; Level bard 2,
nightblade 2, sorcerer/wizard 2
This spell functions like shadow conjuration, except
that it duplicates any sorcerer or wizard conjuration
(summoning) or conjuration (creation) spell of 1st level
or lower. The illusory conjurations created deal onefifth
(20%) damage to nonbelievers, and non-damaging
effects are 20% likely to work against nonbelievers.
SHADOW COURIER
School illusion (shadow) [shadow]; Level bard 3,
nightblade 3, sorcerer/wizard 4
Casting Time 1 standard action
Components V, S, F (a small, empty box lined with
black cloth or velvet)
Range touch
Target one touched object of up to 2 cu. ft./level, plus
one willing creature
Duration 1 day/level (D)
Saving Throw Will negates (object); Spell Resistance
yes (object)
This spell was originally created by clever smugglers to
better conceal their illegal wares, stashing the objects
within their own shadows. Upon casting the spell, you
touch both the object to be stored and a willing recipient
of the spell. Spell resistance applies to the object (if it
has it) and the object gets a saving throw if it is attended
by an unwilling owner or is magical. If successful, the
object is transformed into shadowstuff which melds
with the shadow of the recipient of the spell, storing the
object within a pocket of the Plane of Shadow. As the
object has been placed into a pocket dimension within
the Plane of Shadow, it does not radiate any magical
aura (if it has one) while it is melded into the recipient’s
shadow, nor can magical means of locating the object
find it unless the spell can function across dimensions.
The target’s shadow does not look any different than
normal, although detect magic still detects the spell.
At any point during the spell’s duration, either the
caster of the spell or the recipient can dismiss the effect
(a standard action), at which point the object returns
to the plane the recipient is currently on in an adjacent
square. If the effect is dispelled or the duration ends, the
item appears adjacent to the recipient (similar to if the
spell was dismissed). A creature can only be targeted by
one shadow courier spell at a time. Should another shadow
courier spell be cast on the target, the previous spell’s
duration immediately ends. This spell cannot affect
artifacts or other sorts of similarly unique objects.
SHADOW EVOCATION, LESSER
School illusion (shadow) [shadow]; Level bard 3,
nightblade 3, sorcerer/wizard 3
This spell functions like shadow evocation, except that it
enables you to create partially real, illusory versions of
sorcerer or wizard evocation spells of 2nd level or lower.
If recognized as a lesser shadow evocation, a damaging spell
deals only one-fifth (20%) damage.
SHADOW FIELD
School necromancy [darkness]; Level nightblade 5,
sorcerer/wizard 5
Casting Time 1 standard action
Components V, S
Range medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
Effect enervating darkness in 20-ft. radius spread, 20
ft. high
Duration 1 min./level
Saving Throw none Spell Resistance yes
This spell creates a destructive area of shadowstuff
and negative energy, sapping the strength of creatures
within. The lighting within the entire area plummets to
darkness, as a deeper darkness spell. A living creature within
the shadow field takes 1d4 points of Strength damage
each round on your turn while in the field. A creature
reduced to 0 Strength by this effect is slain instantly. This
is a negative energy effect. Creatures that are immune to
negative energy or are healed by it do not lose Strength
while in the shadow field, though it is still considered dark
to them as deeper darkness.
SHADOW FORM
School transmutation [darkness]; Level alchemist 4,
bard 4, magus 4, nightblade 3, sorcerer/wizard 4
Casting Time 1 standard action
Components V, S, M (some ink and powdered chalk)
Range touch
Target willing corporeal creature touched
Duration 2 min./level (D)
Saving Throw none; Spell Resistance no
The subject of this spell turns into a natural shadow. This
functions as the spell gaseous form, though the subject does
not gain a fly speed; instead, it can move at a speed of 30
feet along any surface, including walls and ceilings. The
target must remain adjacent to a surface for the duration.
Unlike with gaseous form, the creature is not subject to
wind effects and can enter water or other liquids, though
it cannot enter into areas of supernatural darkness.
While in this form, the creature gains a competence
bonus on Stealth checks while in dim light or darkness
equal to your caster level (maximum +10). The creature
can also turn itself back and forth from shadow form
to its normal material form as a full-round action. Each
time it returns to its normal form, the duration of the
spell is decreased by 2 minutes. The creature cannot take
any items with it when it turns into a shadow that it did
not have in its possession when the spell was cast.

# 58
SHADOW GATE
School illusion (shadow) [shadow]; Level bard 5,
nightblade 5, sorcerer/wizard 5
Casting Time 1 full-round action
Components V, S
Range 60 ft.
Area 60-ft. cone
Duration instantaneous
Saving Throw Will negates; Spell Resistance yes
Your shadow grows to an immense size, stretching into a
60 foot cone shape along a surface. The shadow can go
in any direction you choose (not just the way it normally
falls due to lighting), and can go along any surface
(including walls) so long as the total distance measured
across all surfaces does not exceed 60 feet.
The area within your shadow acts as a temporary
blending between the Material Plane and the Plane of
Shadow, distorting the location and distances between
creatures. You can affect one creature per two caster
levels that are in the spell area, including yourself
(maximum 10). The creatures must be on the surface
the shadow is cast on or within 10 feet above the
surface. Each creature affected must make a Will save
or be teleported to another location within the spell’s
area that you designate. You can make each creature
affected go to a different location, including a space that
another creature was teleported from with this spell.
The teleportation cannot end in a space that is by nature
hazardous to the creature you are teleporting, such as
teleporting a creature that cannot fly to a space 20 feet
up a wall.
A creature cannot cast this spell if it does not cast a
shadow, such as by being a vampire or being under a curse
of the lightless spell.

You use material from the Plane of Shadow to shape
quasi-real illusions of one or more necromantic spells.
Shadow necromancy can mimic any sorcerer or wizard
necromancy spell of 3rd level or lower. Shadow necromancies
are only one-fifth (20%) as strong as the real things,
though creatures who believe the shadow necromancies to
be real are affected by them at full strength. Any creature
that interacts with the spell can make a Will save to
recognize its true nature.
Spells that deal damage have normal effects unless
the affected creature succeeds on a Will save. Each
disbelieving creature takes only one-fifth (20%) damage
from the attack. If the disbelieved attack has a special
effect other than damage, that effect is only 20% likely to
occur. Regardless of the result of the save to disbelieve,
an affected creature is also allowed any save that the spell
being simulated allows, but the save DC is set according
to shadow necromancy’s level (4th) rather than the spell’s
normal level. In addition, any effect created by shadow
necromancy allows Spell Resistance, even if the spell it
is simulating does not. Shadow objects or substances
have normal effects except against those who disbelieve
them. Against disbelievers, they are 20% likely to work.
Spells that create permanent effects (such as sculpt
corpseAPG, contagion, or blindness/deafness) only last for 1
hour per caster level, as opposed to being permanent.
In the case of spells that impart diseases, the disease is
removed automatically at the end of this time, including
any disease that may have been spread to creatures that
were not the original target of the spell. You cannot
create undead with this spell. Objects automatically
succeed on their Will saves against this spell.
SHADOW NECROMANCY, GREATER
School illusion (shadow) [shadow]; Level sorcerer/
wizard 7
This spell functions like shadow necromancy, except that
it duplicates any sorcerer or wizard necromancy spell
of 6th level or lower. The illusory damaging effects
deal three-fifths (60%) damage to nonbelievers, and
non-damaging effects are 60% likely to work against
nonbelievers. You cannot create undead with this spell.
SHADOW NECROMANCY, LESSER
School illusion (shadow) [shadow]; Level nightblade 2,
sorcerer/wizard 2
This spell functions like shadow necromancy, except that it
duplicates any sorcerer or wizard necromancy spell of
1st level or lower. The illusory damaging effects deal onefifth
(20%) damage to nonbelievers, and non-damaging
effects are 20% likely to work against nonbelievers. You
cannot create undead with this spell.

# 59
You cause an area to be overlaid by the Plane of Shadow,
its mutable shape and space distorting the movement and
positioning of creatures and objects in the area. The area
of the spell is centered on you when you cast the spell
and stays in that location thereafter, even if you move.
Each round on your turn, starting with the round you
cast the spell, the space is distorted in a different way,
affecting everything within. Roll a d100 to determine
what effects occur on that round, as shown on Table:
Shadow Space.
Each effect lasts until the start of your next turn, at
which point you roll for a new effect, except for the
effects of falling prone and being teleported a random
direction, which happen once when you roll the effect.
A creature with the planar adaptationAPG spell cast on it
is immune the effects of this spell, both beneficial and
harmful. This spell does not function in the area of a
dimensional lock spell or similar effects that block planar
travel or teleportation.

Saving Throw Will disbelief (if interacted with); Spell
Resistance no
You can create quasi-real structures out of shadowstuff.
The structures can physically impede or support
creatures as a real structure would. You can create one
of the following structures, chosen when you cast the
spell:
• Wall – You can create a simple wall. The wall can be
as short as 1 foot and as high as 10 feet, is 6 inches
thick, and can be up to 5 feet long per caster level
(maximum 100 feet). The wall must be vertical and
anchored to the floor. If you desire, you may place
a single door, large enough for a large sized creature
or smaller, at one point in the wall. The door is not
locked and cannot be magically locked, but can be
locked or barred by mundane means.
• Bridge – You create a long bridge to cross a space.
The bridge is 6 inches thick, 5 feet wide, and up to
20 feet per caster level long (maximum 400 feet). The
bridge must be anchored on both sides and must be
horizontal or nearly horizontal (no more than a 10º
incline).
• Stairs – You create a set of stairs or a ramp for
creatures to travel on. The stairs or ramp must be
straight and must be anchored on at least one end.

# 60
The ramp or steps cannot exceed a 45º incline. The
stairs can be up to 10 feet wide. The structure can rise
up to 5 feet per two caster levels (maximum 50 feet)
and can stretch horizontally this same distance.
The structure must be continuous and unbroken
when formed. If its surface is broken by any object or
creature when it is cast, the spell fails. The structure
must begin within the range of the spell, but can extend
outside of the spell’s range. The structures can support
up to 500 lbs. per caster level. Any creature or object
that causes the total weight to exceed this amount
simply passes through the structure as if it didn’t exist.
Any solid structure you make has 5 hardness and 10 hit
points for every 5 foot cube of the structure. A creature
that disbelieves the spell ignores the hardness of the
structure with any attacks it uses and deals full damage
with energy attacks (instead of the normal half damage
objects take). The creature also becomes unimpeded by
any structures you make, allowing it to move through
the structure as if it wasn’t there, though the structure
still blocks line of sight. A creature that disbelieves the
structure may opt to use the structure as if it was real
should it be beneficial, such as walking along a bridge
or up a flight of stairs, but when it does it must treat
the structure as completely real, including blocking the
creature’s movement. A creature that made its saving
throw can choose whether to treat the structure as real
or fake at any point on its turn as a free action, though it
cannot do so when inside of the shadow structure.

Duration concentration + 1 hour/level (D)
Saving Throw Will disbelief (if interacted with); Spell
Resistance no
This spell functions as mirage arcana, but the illusory
structures you make are quasi-real. Any structures you
create are made out of shadowstuff; this functions
similarly to a shadow structure spell, though you can make
any structure shape you desire. Created structures have
10 hardness and 20 hit points for every 5-ft.-cube of
the structure. A creature that disbelieves the spell is
unimpeded by any structures you make with the shadow
terrain, though it can choose to use the structures if it
desires, such as walking up a flight of stairs or across
a bridge (as when disbelieving a shadow structure spell).
A creature that disbelieves the spell also ignores the
hardness of any structures you created and deals full
damage with energy attacks (instead of the normal half
damage objects take).
SHADOW TOUCH
School necromancy; Level nightblade 4, sorcerer/

Casting Time 1 standard action
Components V, S
Range touch
Target creature or creatures touched (up to one per
level)
Duration 1 round/level
Saving Throw none; Spell Resistance yes
Your touch is infused with corrupting negative energy.
Once per round, you may deliver a touch attack that
inflicts 1d4+1 points of Strength damage. A creature
reduced to 0 Strength by this spell is slain instantly.
Creatures that are immune to negative energy damage or
are healed by it are immune to this spell’s effects.

Casting Time 1 standard action
Components V, S
Range 15 ft.
Area 15 ft.-radius spread, centered on you
Duration instantaneous
Saving Throw Reflex half Spell Resistance yes
This spell creates a stormy whirlwind of shadows,
lightning, and ice around yourself, drawing upon
the Plane of Shadow to create a twisted replica of a
fearsome thunderstorm. Any creature caught in the area
of the shadow vortex must make a Reflex save or take 1d6
damage per caster level (max 10d6). Half of this damage
is cold damage, the other half is electricity damage.
Creatures that fail their saving throws are dazzled for
1d4 rounds by the shadowy energies.
SHADOW WOUND
School transmutation [darkness]; Level antipaladin 2,
inquisitor 3, magus 3, nightblade 3
Casting Time 1 swift action
Components V, S
Range short (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
Target one creature
Duration 1 round
Saving Throw Will negates; Spell Resistance yes
You form a bond between the creature’s shadow and its
physical being, causing injuries inflicted upon its shadow
to harm the creature itself.
When you cast the spell, the target receives a Will save
to negate the effect. Otherwise, the creature’s shadow
stretches in a line in a direction you specify out from the
creature. The length of the shadow depends on the size
of the creature affected, as shown on Table: Shadow
Wound.

# 61
For the duration of the spell, any attacks made against
the creature’s shadow deal full damage to the creature
itself. The shadow’s AC is equal to the creature’s touch
AC. Damage reduction and energy resistance apply
normally to the damage dealt. If a damaging area attack
would include both the creature and its shadow in the
area of effect, the damage is only applied once. Only
damaging effects (including ability damage, penalties,
drain, or nonlethal damage) can be dealt through the
shadow; other effects that may accompany the damage
do not apply. Precision damage and critical hit damage
do not work through the shadow. If the targeted creature
has a creature or object hidden in its shadow, such as a
nightblade’s shadow bond class feature or from a shadow
courier spell, that object or creature takes full damage
from any attacks made against the target’s shadow.
A creature cannot be targeted by this spell if it does
not cast a shadow, such as by being a vampire or being
under a curse of the lightless spell. Once the spell ends,
the creature’s shadow returns to normal and it cannot
be subjected to the effects of this spell for 24 hours
(regardless of its source).

Range short (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
Target one creature’s or object’s shadow
Duration 1 min./level
Saving Throw Will negates (harmless); Spell
Resistance yes (harmless)
You alter the shape and size of a creature’s shadow
or an object’s shadow. You can make the shadow up
to twice as wide or tall, or half as wide or tall (or any
combination of those). For every five caster levels you
have, the maximum multiplier or divisor of the shadow’s
dimensions increases by two, being four times as large
or one-quarter the size at 5th level, six times as large or
one-sixth the size at 10th level, and so on. While this
has no direct impact on the creature or object, it may
grant circumstantial bonuses on certain skill checks,
such as making the creature’s shadow grow as part of an
Intimidate check or shrink to better conceal one’s self
for a Stealth check, subject to GM discretion. This spell
cannot target a creautre that does not cast a shadow.
SNUFF

Casting Time 1 standard action
Components V, S, M (a bit of soot)
Range short (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
Target one non-magical light source
Duration instantaneous
Saving Throw none; Spell Resistance no
This spell extinguishes a single non-magical light source
within range, such as a torch, lantern, or sunrod. While
an alchemical-based light source such as a sunrod cannot
be reused, torches, lanterns, and small fires can be relit
assuming they still have fuel. This spell is not strong
enough to put out a fire larger than a normal campfire.
SPECTRES
School illusion (shadow) [shadow]; Level sorcerer/
wizard 9
This spell functions like shadow necromancy, except that it
duplicates any necromancy spell of 8th level or lower.
The illusory damaging effects deal four-fifths (80%)
damage to nonbelievers, and non-damaging effects are
80% likely to work against nonbelievers. You cannot
create undead with this spell.

Range close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
Effect one summoned creature
Duration 1 round/level (D)
Saving Throw none; Spell Resistance no
This spell summons a terrifying creature (typically an
aberration, outsider, or undead). It appears where you
designate and acts immediately, on your turn. It attacks
your opponents to the best of its ability. If you can
communicate with the creature, you can direct it not to
attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other
actions. The spell conjures one of the creatures from the
1st Level list on Table: Summon Horror. You choose
which kind of creature to summon, and you can choose
a different one each time you cast the spell.
A summoned creature cannot summon or otherwise
conjure another creature or create spawn, nor can it use
any teleportation or planar travel abilities. Creatures

# 62
cannot be summoned into an environment that cannot
support them. Creatures summoned using this spell
cannot use spells or spell-like abilities that duplicate
spells with expensive foci or material components (such
as wish).

Saving Throw Fortitude negates; Spell Resistance yes
This spell functions as symbol of death, except all creatures
within 60 feet of a symbol of blinding are permanently
blinded (as blindness/deafness). Unlike symbol of death, symbol
of blinding has no hit point limit; once it is triggered, a
symbol of blinding remains active for 1 minute per caster
level.

Effect one symbol
Duration see text
Saving Throw Fortitude negates, see text; Spell
Resistance yes, see text
This spell functions as symbol of death, except upon
activation the light level within 60 feet of the symbol
immediately drops to darkness, regardless of existing
lighting conditions. All creatures within 60 feet of a
symbol of darkness must make a Fortitude save or become
fatigued. This effect cannot make a creature already
fatigued become exhausted. Unlike symbol of death, symbol
of darkness has no hit point limit; once it is triggered, a
symbol of darkness remains active for 1 minute per caster
level.
Symbol of darkness can be made permanent with a
permanency spell by a caster of 10th level or higher for the
cost of 5,000 gp.
UMBRAL ASSISTANT
School illusion (shadow) [shadow]; Level nightblade 1
Casting Time 1 standard action
Components V, S, M (a vial of average invisible ink
worth 10 gp)
Range close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
Effect one shadowy, humanoid assistant
Duration 1 hour/level (D)
Saving Throw Fortitude negates, see text; Spell
Resistance yes
As you finish the spell, you open the bottle of invisible
ink, a fine mist coming from its opening as the ink is
consumed and evaporated. Darkness coalesces about
a nearby space and takes on a solid form of roughly
human shape, ready to serve you unquestioningly.
Umbral assistant is but one of many spells created by
nightblades to better utilize the powers of their shadow
magic. The umbral assistant appears as a medium-sized
humanoid composed entirely out of shadows (though
it is still corporeal and takes up a space); its appearance
is up to you, though it cannot be made to look like a
specific person and always has a shadowy form, so it is
never mistaken for an actual creature. The umbral assistant
functions as an unseen servant spell, and can accomplish
any task that an unseen servant can. It has AC 15, 15 hit
points, a Strength score of 6 (meaning it can lift up to 60
pounds and drag up to 300 pounds), and a speed of 30
feet. It uses your saving throws for its own. If reduced
to 0 hit points, the spell ends. Unlike unseen servant,
it is visible when in bright or normal light. It gains a
+10 bonus on Stealth checks to remain unseen when
in dim light; in darkness or supernatural darkness, it is
effectively invisible.
Once during the spell’s duration, you can command
the assistant to charge at a creature within 30 feet of
itself (a standard action for you) and attempt to cloy it
with shadows. The umbral assistant disperses the darkness
creating its being over the target’s body; the target must
make a Fortitude save or be blinded for 1d4 rounds. If
you target a creature that has spell resistance, you must
overcome the target’s spell resistance in order to blind it;
failure to do so ends the spell. Whether or not the save
was successful, this spell ends.
UMBRAL BERSERKER
School illusion (shadow) [shadow]; Level nightblade 2
Casting Time 1 standard action
Components V, S, M (a vial of average invisible ink
worth 10 gp)
Range close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
Effect one shadowy, humanoid berserker
Duration 1 round/level (D)
Saving Throw Fortitude partial, see text; Spell
Resistance yes
As you finish the spell, you open the bottle of invisible
ink, a fine mist coming from its opening as the ink is
consumed and evaporated. Darkness coalesces about
a nearby space and takes on a solid form of roughly
human shape that holds a massive weapon, its purewhite
eyes blazing with a silent fury.
Created by nightblades to help when outnumbered
by foes, the umbral berserker is a warrior that attacks
with a weapon of shadowstuff and draining negative
energy. The umbral berserker appears as a medium-sized
humanoid composed entirely out of shadows (though it
is still corporeal and takes up a space), clad in armor and
wielding a two-handed melee weapon appropriate for its
size; its appearance (including the form of the weapon)
is up to you, though it cannot be made to look like a
specific person and always has a shadowy form, so it is
never mistaken for an actual creature. It has an AC equal
to 10 + 1/2 your caster level + your Charisma bonus, an
attack bonus equal to your caster level + your Charisma
bonus, 3 hit points per caster level, and a movement
speed of 30 feet. It uses your saving throws for its own.
If reduced to 0 hit points, the spell ends. Upon creating
the umbral berserker, you designate a creature within range
for it to target, which it attacks on each of its turns
if able. You can change its target at any time as a free
action. The berserker cannot move outside of the spell’s
range, regardless of its target.
The berserker takes its turn directly after yours, can
attack only once on each of its turns, and has a reach
of 5 feet. It cannot make attacks of opportunity. When

# 65
the berserker first attacks a creature, you must overcome
that creature’s spell resistance or have the berserker
be rendered unable to harm it. The berserker never
again attacks such creatures. Each hit deals 2d6 + your
Charisma bonus of either bludgeoning, piercing, or
slashing damage, as appropriate for the weapon it wields,
critically threats on a 20, and deals double damage on a
critical hit. Every time it successfully hits a target, the
target must also make a Fortitude save or take 1 point of
Strength damage. The berserker’s weapon is considered
magic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction;
at 7th caster level, it is considered silver, and at 14th
caster level, it is considered cold iron. As with an umbral
servant, it gains a +10 bonus on Stealth checks to remain
unseen when in dim light; in darkness or supernatural
darkness, it is effectively invisible.
Once during the spell’s duration, you can command
the berserker to charge at a creature within 30 feet of
itself (a standard action for you) and swing its weapon
in a spinning strike. It makes an attack roll against each
creature within 10 feet of itself, dealing damage as
normal to each creature it hits. After resolving the attack,
this spell ends.
UMBRAL DEFENDER
School illusion (shadow) [shadow]; Level nightblade 3
Casting Time 1 standard action
Components V, S, M (a vial of good invisible ink worth
25 gp)
Range close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
Effect one shadowy, humanoid defender
Duration 1 round/level (D)
Saving Throw none; Spell Resistance yes
As you finish the spell, you open the bottle of invisible
ink, a fine mist coming from its opening as the ink is
consumed and evaporated. Darkness coalesces about
a nearby space and takes on a solid form of roughly
human shape. Appearing to be armored and brandishing
a weapon and shield, it takes on a defensive posture,
ready to protect its charge no matter the cost.
Created by nightblades to protect oneself while
casting or performing other tasks, the umbral defender is a
warrior that defends you and prevents opponents from
reaching you. The umbral defender appears as a mediumsized
humanoid composed entirely out of shadows
(though it is still corporeal and takes up a space), clad in
armor and wielding a one-handed melee weapon and a

# 66
shield appropriate for its size; its appearance (including
the form of the weapon) is up to you, though it cannot
be made to look like a specific person and always has
a shadowy form, so it is never mistaken for an actual
creature. It has an AC equal to 10 + 1/2 your caster
level + your Charisma bonus, an attack bonus equal to
your caster level + your Charisma bonus, 5 hit points
per caster level, and a movement speed of 30 feet. It
uses your saving throws for its own. If reduced to 0 hit
points, the spell ends. Upon creating the umbral defender,
you designate a space for it to defend, which it moves to
on its turn. You can designate a new space for it to move
to at any time as a free action. The defender cannot
move outside of the spell’s range.
The defender takes its turn directly after yours,
though it only uses its turn to move if you have directed
it to do so. The defender does not attack on its turn;
instead, the defender can make a number of attacks
of opportunity each round equal to your Charisma
bonus. It has a reach of 5 feet. Creatures only provoke
attacks of opportunity from the defender by moving,
not by other actions such as casting a spell. When the
defender first attacks a creature, you must overcome
that creature’s spell resistance or have the defender
be rendered unable to harm it. The defender never
again attacks such creatures. Each hit deals 3d6 + your
Charisma bonus of either bludgeoning, piercing, or
slashing damage, as appropriate for the weapon it wields,
critically threats on a 20, and deals double damage on
a critical hit. Every time it hits a target, the defender
makes a combat maneuver check against that creature.
The defender’s combat maneuver bonus is equal to its
attack bonus. If successful, the target cannot move for
the rest of its turn, as if the defender had the Stand Still
feat. The defender’s weapon is considered magic for the
purpose of overcoming damage reduction; at 7th caster
level, it is considered silver, and at 14th caster level, it is
considered cold iron. As with an umbral servant, it gains
a +10 bonus on Stealth checks to remain unseen when
in dim light; in darkness or supernatural darkness, it is
effectively invisible.
Once during the spell’s duration, you can command
the defender to intercept damage from you (an
immediate action for you). Until the start of your next
turn, half of any damage you would take is redirected to
the defender, as if it had cast shield other on you. Once it
either reaches 0 hit points from the redirected damage
or when it is the start of your next turn, this spell ends.
UMBRAL INFORMANT
School illusion (shadow) [shadow]; Level nightblade 4
Casting Time 1 standard action
Components V, S, M (a vial of good invisible ink worth
25 gp)
Range close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
Effect one shadowy, humanoid informant
Duration 10 minutes/level (D)
Saving Throw none; Spell Resistance no
As you finish the spell, you open the bottle of invisible
ink, a fine mist coming from its opening as the ink is
consumed and evaporated. Darkness coalesces about
a nearby space and takes on a solid form of roughly
human shape. Its glowing eyes shift about as if on the
lookout for foes while it quietly waits for instruction.
Created by nightblades to survey areas and spy on
targets, the umbral informant is a scout that can relay
information to its creator. The umbral informant appears
as a medium-sized humanoid composed entirely out
of shadows (though it is still corporeal and takes up
a space); its appearance is up to you, though it cannot
be made to look like a specific person and always has
a shadowy form, so it is never mistaken for an actual
creature. It has AC 10, 10 hit points, and a Strength
score of 6 (meaning it can lift up to 60 pounds and drag
up to 300 pounds). The informant cannot attack; it is
never allowed an attack roll. It can move at a speed of
30 feet along any surface, including walls, ceilings, and
even across or through liquids, though it cannot fly. It
uses your saving throws for its own. If reduced to 0
hit points, the spell ends. While the informant must be
originally created within the range of the spell, it can
thereafter move freely outside of the area to wherever
you send it.
You can communicate telepathically with the umbral
informant. It tells you any information that you wish to
know that it can perceive. It has the see in darkness
ability, so it can see to any distance in darkness, even
magical darkness. It can read and speak any language you
can. It has a Stealth check and a Perception check equal
to your caster level. As with an umbral servant, it gains a
+10 bonus on Stealth checks to remain unseen when
in dim light; in darkness or supernatural darkness, it is
effectively invisible. The informant itself can turn into
a flat shadow at will to hide, as a shadow form spell. It
cannot take any items with it when it uses this ability.
Once during the spell’s duration, you can command
the informant to become a magical sensor (a standard
action for you). The umbral informant becomes a scrying
sensor, functioning as if you had cast clairaudience/
clairvoyance at the informant’s location. The effect allows
you to both hear and see that location for 1 minute (as
opposed to one or the other). Because of the informant’s
see in darkness ability, you can see in any darkness, even
supernatural darkness, around the location. This effect
can only be triggered if the informant is within the
normal range of a clairaudience/clairvoyance spell from you
(400 ft. + 40 ft. per caster level). Once the clairaudience/
clairvoyance effects end, this spell ends.

# 67
School illusion (shadow) [shadow]; Level nightblade 5
Casting Time 1 standard action
Components V, S, M (a vial of superior invisible ink
worth 75 gp)
Range close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
Effect one shadowy, humanoid magician
Duration 1 round/level (D)
Saving Throw see text; Spell Resistance yes
As you finish the spell, you open the bottle of invisible
ink, a fine mist coming from its opening as the ink is
consumed and evaporated. Darkness coalesces about
a nearby space and takes on a solid form of roughly
human shape. The being wears ornate robes of swirling
darkness, one hand holding a shadowy staff, the other
crackling with magical power.
Created by nightblades to assist in magic casting, the
umbral magician imparts metamagic feats upon nearby
arcane spells. The umbral magician appears as a mediumsized
humanoid composed entirely out of shadows
(though it is still corporeal and takes up a space), wearing
robes and holding a staff appropriate for its size; its
appearance (including the shape of the staff) is up to
you, though it cannot be made to look like a specific
person and always has a shadowy form, so it is never
mistaken for an actual creature. It has an AC equal to
10 + 1/2 your caster level + your Charisma bonus, 3 hit
points per caster level, and a movement speed of 30 feet.
The magician cannot attack; it is never allowed an attack
roll. It uses your saving throws for its own. If reduced
to 0 hit points, the spell ends. Upon creating the umbral
magician, you designate a space for it to stand, which it
moves to on its turn. You can designate a new space for
it to move to at any time as a free action. The magician
cannot move outside of the spell’s range.
The magician takes its turn directly after yours, but the
only actions it takes is to move as you direct or to change
what metamagic effect it imparts. Any arcane spells cast
within 10 feet of the magician can be cast as if one of
the following metamagic feats was applied to it (without
increasing the spell level or casting time): Enlarge Spell,
Extend Spell, Piercing SpellUM, Selective SpellAPG, Silent
Spell, or Still Spell. You choose the metamagic feat that
is applied when you cast umbral magician, and can will the
magician to change to a different metamagic feat (a fullround
action for the magician). As with an umbral servant,
it gains a +10 bonus on Stealth checks to remain unseen
when in dim light; in darkness or supernatural darkness,
it is effectively invisible.
Once during the spell’s duration, you can command
the magician to create a powerful evocation (a move
action for you). It casts one of the following effects,
chosen when you give the command: fireball, lightning
bolt, pain strikeAPG, or shadow blast*. The spell is modified
by whatever metamagic feat the magician is currently
enhancing spells with. It uses your caster level for the
effect, your concentration check (if needed), and your
spell DC for the created effect. After it finishes casting,
this spell ends.
UMBRAL NIGHTBLADE
School illusion (shadow) [shadow]; Level nightblade 6
Casting Time 1 standard action
Components V, S, M (a vial of superior invisible ink
worth 75 gp)
Range close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
Effect one shadowy, humanoid nightblade
Duration 1 round/level (D)
Saving Throw Fortitude partial, see text; Spell
Resistance yes
As you finish the spell, you open the bottle of invisible
ink, a fine mist coming from its opening as the ink is
consumed and evaporated. Darkness coalesces about a
nearby space and takes on a solid form of roughly human
shape. The being appears fully armed and armored and
poises to strike, ready to take on any challenge.
One of the most powerful shadow spells available
to a nightblade, umbral nightblade creates a shadowy
humanoid that had many of the skills possessed by real
nightblades. The umbral nightblade appears as a mediumsized
humanoid composed entirely out of shadows
(though it is still corporeal and takes up a space), clad in
armor and wielding melee weapons appropriate for its
size; its appearance (including the form of the weapon)
is up to you, though it cannot be made to look like a
specific person and always has a shadowy form, so it is
never mistaken for an actual creature. It has an AC equal
to 10 + 1/2 your caster level + your Charisma bonus, an
attack bonus equal to your caster level + your Charisma
bonus, 6 hit points per caster level, and a movement
speed of 30 feet. It uses your saving throws for its own.
If reduced to 0 hit points, the spell ends. Upon creating
the umbral nightblade, you designate a creature within
range for it to target, which it attacks on each of its
turns if able. You can redirect its target at any time as a
free action. The nightblade cannot move outside of the
spell’s range, regardless of its target.
The nightblade takes its turn directly after yours and
has a reach of 5 feet. It can make a number of attacks
of opportunity each round equal to your Charisma
bonus. When making a full attack, it makes one attack
per six caster levels at its full attack bonus. When the
nightblade first attacks a creature, you must overcome
that creature’s spell resistance or have the nightblade
be rendered unable to harm it. The nightblade never
again attacks such creatures. Each hit deals 3d6 + your
Charisma bonus of either bludgeoning, piercing, or
slashing damage, as appropriate for the weapon it wields,

# 68
critically threats on a 19 or 20, and deals double damage
on a critical hit. Every time it successfully hits a target,
the target must also make a Fortitude save or take 1d3
points of Strength damage. The nightblade’s weapon is
considered magic, silver, and cold iron for the purpose
of overcoming damage reduction. The nightblade uses
your skill bonuses in order to make any skill checks
you ask it to, though it cannot make Craft, Knowledge,
Linguistics, Profession, or Spellcraft checks.
What makes the umbral nightblade especially deadly
is that it has access to nightblade arts, as an actual
nightblade. It gains one art per six caster levels, chosen
from the following list: beckoning shadows, dusk strike,
fall of night, mystic shade, shadow motion, shadow run,
shadow transference, shifting focus, warp strike, or any
art that you have, assuming it can benefit from the art.
It uses these arts as you direct it to (a free action for
you). To use the arts, it is created with its own reserve of
shadow surges equal to 1 shadow surge per four caster
levels (max 5), though it cannot create any on its own.
It can also shadow shift as a nightblade, and can shift a
total of 10 feet per caster level. As with an umbral servant,
it gains a +10 bonus on Stealth checks to remain unseen
when in dim light; in darkness or supernatural darkness,
it is effectively invisible.
Once during the spell’s duration, you can command
the nightblade to create a shadow effect for you (a
standard action for you). It casts one of the following
effects, chosen when you give the command: shadow
conjuration, shadow evocation, or shadow necromancy*. It uses
your caster level for the effect, your concentration check
(if needed), and uses your spell DC for the created
effect. After it finishes casting, this spell ends.
VOID FIELD
School illusion (glamer) [darkness]; Level antipaladin 4,
cleric 5, inquisitor 5, nightblade 5
Casting Time 1 standard action
Components V, S
Range medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./2 levels)
Area 20-ft.-radius emanation centered on a point in space
Duration 1 round/level (D)
Saving Throw none; Spell Resistance no
This spell creates an area devoid of all sensory input.
The lighting in the area of the spell immediately drops to
supernatural darkness, regardless of existing conditions.
No sound permeates the space, as if under the effects
of a silence spell. Creatures within the area are considered
both blind and deaf. Scents and tastes are completely
erased in the area, preventing creatures from using the
scent ability and nullifying the effects of spells that rely
on smell or taste, such as stinking cloud. Creatures cannot
properly feel things by touch; this negates the effects of
spells with the pain descriptor and prevents creatures
from using extraordinary abilities that rely on touch or
vibrations, such as tremorsense. Creatures are unaware
of any injury they receive while in the area of the void
field (as they cannot feel pain), but they still take full
damage. As they cannot properly perceive things with
their senses, creatures take a -10 penalty on all Strengthand
Dexterity-based skill checks and automatically fail all
Perception checks while in the area.
WALL OF DARKNESS
School evocation [darkness]; Level nightblade 3,
sorcerer/wizard 3
Casting Time 1 standard action
Components V, S
Range medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
Effect opaque wall of shadows up to 10-ft. long/level,
20 ft. high and 5 ft. thick
Duration 1 round/level
Saving Throw see text; Spell Resistance yes
You create a wall of black shadows that cannot be seen
through and saps the strength of those that pass through
it. The lighting within the area of the wall is lowered to
darkness (regardless of existing lighting conditions) and
the light level within 10 feet of the wall is lowered by 1
step. Creatures on opposite sides of the wall have total
concealment (50% miss chance) from each other unless
they possess darkvision. If a creature attempts to pass
through the wall, they must make a Fortitude save or
be fatigued. This effect cannot make a creature that is
already fatigued become exhausted.
The wall must be vertical and rectangular. It need not
touch the ground. The wall must be continuous and
unbroken when formed. If its surface is broken by any
object or creature when it is cast, the spell fails.
WALL OF DARKNESS, GREATER
School evocation [darkness]; Level nightblade 5,
sorcerer/wizard 5
Effect opaque wall of shadows up to 20 ft. long/level
or a ring of darkness with a radius of up to 5 ft./two
levels; either form 20 ft. high and 5 ft. thick
This spell functions as wall of darkness, except as noted
above. In addition, the area within the wall is treated
as supernatural darkness (as the spell deeper darkness).
Creatures on opposite sides of the wall have total
concealment (50% miss chance) from each other unless
they possess the see in darkness ability or some other
method of seeing through supernatural darkness. A
creature passing through the wall must make a Fortitude
save or become exhausted.
