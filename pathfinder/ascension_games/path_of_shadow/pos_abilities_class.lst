###Block: Nightblade Class Features
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Nightblade ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Nightblade Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.6	DESC:A nightblade is proficient with all simple weapons, plus the longsword, rapier, scythe, short sword, shortbow, and spiked chain. They are proficient with light armor, but not with shields. A nightblade can cast nightblade spells while wearing light armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. Like other arcane spellcasters, a nightblade wearing medium or heavy armor or wielding a shield incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has somatic components. A multiclass nightblade still incurs the normal arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes.
Spells				KEY:Nightblade ~ Spells								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Nightblade Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.6	DESC:A nightblade casts arcane spells drawn from the nightblade spell list. She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a nightblade must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a nightblade’s spell is 10 + the spell level + the nightblade’s Charisma modifier. A nightblade can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level each day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Nightblade. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Charisma score (see the Ability Scores section in Chapter 1 of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook). A nightblade’s selection of spells is extremely limited. A nightblade begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the nightblade’s choice. At each new nightblade level, she gains one or more new spells as indicated on Table: Nightblade Spells Known (Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a nightblade knows is not affected by his Charisma score. The numbers on Table: Nightblade Spells Known are fixed.). These new spells can be common spells chosen from the nightblade spell list, or they can be unusual spells that the nightblade has gained some understanding of through study. Upon reaching 5th level, and at every third nightblade level thereafter (8th, 11th, and so on), a nightblade can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the nightblade “loses” the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell’s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least one level lower than the highest-level nightblade spell she can cast. A nightblade may swap out only a single spell at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. A nightblade need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not used up her allotment of spells per day for the spell’s level.
Cantrips				KEY:Nightblade ~ Cantrips								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Nightblade Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.7	DESC:Nightblades learn a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table: Nightblade Spells Known under “Spells Known.” These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.
Path					KEY:Nightblade ~ Path									CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Nightblade Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.7	DESC:The teachings of shadow magic are complex and diverse, but mastering all of its powers is nearly impossible. Instead, nightblades focus on a particular aspect of shadow magic, greatly enhancing their capabilities in that area. Each nightblade must choose a path at 1st level, representing the specialization of her shadow magic. Once chosen, it cannot be changed. A nightblade gains a technique for her path at 1st level, 5th level, and every five levels thereafter. The techniques a nightblade gains are described in her chosen path. Each path also has an associated path power, which the nightblade can use once per day. The nightblade can use this power an additional time per day at 4th level and every three levels thereafter, to a maximum of seven times per day at 19th level. The nightblade’s path also grants her additional class features, including an ability that utilizes shadow surges (see below) and more choices when selecting nightblade arts. These features are described in the path’s entry.
Evasion				KEY:Nightblade ~ Evasion								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Nightblade Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.7	DESC:A nightblade of 2nd level can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the nightblade is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless nightblade does not gain the benefit of evasion.
Shadow Surge			KEY:Nightblade ~ Shadow Surge							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Nightblade Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.7	DESC:At 2nd level, the nightblade gains the ability to create a condensed reserve of energy from the Plane of Shadow which she can expend to great effect, but creating the reserve takes effort. The nightblade can spend a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity to gain a single shadow surge. When she does this, her shadow becomes darker and more distinct as it is infused with the planar energy. The shadow surge is an expendable resource that the nightblade can use to fuel her various abilities. She cannot have more than one surge at a time, but there is otherwise no limitation on how many times a day the nightblade can create or use shadow surges. The nightblade has these surges indefinitely until she expends them, though she loses her surges if she is ever unconscious, asleep, or killed. The nightblade can expend a shadow surge as a free action when making a Stealth check to enshroud herself in darkness, letting her roll twice and take the better result. In addition, the nightblade gains a method of expending her shadow surge based on her chosen nightblade path. This surge ability is described in the path’s entry. The nightblade can gain new ways to use shadow surges as she grows in skill, typically through gaining a nightblade art (see below).
Nightblade Art			KEY:Nightblade ~ Nightblade Art							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Nightblade Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p8	DESC:As a nightblade gains experience, she learns a number of techniques and powers that enhance her combat skill and shadow magic. Starting at 3rd level, a nightblade gains one nightblade art. She gains an additional nightblade art for every three levels of nightblade attained after 3rd level. A nightblade cannot select a particular art more than once. If a nightblade art calls for a saving throw, the DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 the nightblade’s level + her Charisma modifier. A nightblade can choose from any of the following nightblade arts or from any of the arts listed for her chosen path.
Nighteye				KEY:Nightblade ~ Nighteye								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Nightblade Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.10	DESC:At 3rd level, the nightblade gains darkvision out to 30 feet. At 9th level, this distance increases to 60 feet. If the nightblade already has darkvision, its range is increased by these amounts. She also gains Blind-Fight as a bonus feat. If she already has this feat, she can choose any other feat she qualifies for.
Hide in Plain Sight		KEY:Nightblade ~ Hide in Plain Sight						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Nightblade Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.10	DESC:Starting at 8th level, a nightblade can use the Stealth skill even while being observed. As long as she is within 10 feet of an area of dim light, a nightblade can hide herself from view in the open without anything to actually hide behind. She cannot, however, hide in her own shadow.
Twin Surge				KEY:Nightblade ~ Twin Surge								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Nightblade Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.10	DESC:A nightblade of 8th level or higher can store up to two shadow surges at once. She can gain both surges with a single full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity or gain one surge as a standard action as normal.
Shadow Shift			KEY:Nightblade ~ Shadow Shift							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Nightblade Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.10	DESC:At 9th level, the nightblade gains the ability to travel between shadows as if by means of a dimension door spell. The limitation is that the magical transport must begin and end in an area with at least some dim light. The nightblade can shift 30 feet per level each day in this manner. This amount can be split among many shifts, but each one, no matter how small, counts as a 10-foot increment. This ability functions as if casting a dimension door spell for the purpose of qualifying for and using feats such as Dimensional AgilityUC. She cannot bring other creatures along, except for her familiar (if she has one), and only if it is within arm’s reach. Bringing a familiar does not require additional uses of shadow shift.
Improved Evasion			KEY:Nightblade ~ Improved Evasion							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Nightblade Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.10	DESC:At 11th level, a nightblade’s evasion improves. This ability works like evasion, except that while the nightblade still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, she henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless nightblade does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.
See in Darkness			KEY:Nightblade ~ See in Darkness							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Nightblade Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.10	DESC:At 14th level, a nightblade can see perfectly in natural or magical darkness out to any distance.
Shadowy Realism			KEY:Nightblade ~ Shadowy Realism							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Nightblade Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.10	DESC:At 17th level, the nightblade’s shadow spells become more realistic. Any shadow spell the nightblade casts whose realness is represented as a percentage, such as shadow conjuration or shadow evocation, is 20% more real. This only applies to shadow spells she casts, not to spell-like abilities that mimic shadow spells (such as the shadow energy technique from the Path of the Ravaging Void). This does not stack with other abilities that increase the realism of shadow spells, such as the 20th-level bloodline power of the shadow sorcerer bloodline.
Triple Surge			KEY:Nightblade ~ Triple Surge							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Nightblade Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.10	DESC:A nightblade of 17th level or higher can store up to three shadow surges at once. She can gain all three surges with a single full-round action or can gain a single surge as a standard action.

# Nightblade Art
Beckoning Shadows		KEY:Nightblade Art ~ Beckoning Shadows						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Nightblade Art Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p8	DESC:The nightblade gains the ability to forcibly shadow shift another creature. As a standard action, the nightblade can target a single creature within 50 feet and teleport it in any direction to another location within 30 feet she can see, following the same limitations as her shadow shift ability. The destination must be on solid ground, and the teleportation cannot end in a space that is by nature hazardous to the creature the nightblade is teleporting. A Will save by the target negates the effect. The distance the nightblade teleports a creature with beckoning shadows counts triple against her total daily distance she can teleport with her shadow shift ability. The nightblade must be at least 15th level before selecting this art.
Casting Art			KEY:Nightblade Art ~ Casting Art							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Nightblade Art Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p8	DESC:The nightblade gains a metamagic feat as a bonus feat.
Combat Art			KEY:Nightblade Art ~ Combat Art							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Nightblade Art Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p8	DESC:The nightblade gains a combat feat as a bonus feat.
Dark Resurgence		KEY:Nightblade Art ~ Dark Resurgence						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Nightblade Art Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p8	DESC:The nightblade can quickly recover her shadow powers. Once per day as a free action, the nightblade can gain all of her shadow surges back, up to her maximum amount. The nightblade must be at least 6th level before selecting this art.
Disguising Veil		KEY:Nightblade Art ~ Disguising Veil						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Nightblade Art Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike		SOURCEPAGE:p8	DESC:The nightblade can mask her appearance, as disguise self, for a number of minutes per day equal to her nightblade level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but must be spent in 1-minute increments. The DC to disbelieve the disguising veil is equal to the nightblade’s art DC, rather than the normal DC for disguise self.
Dusk Strike			KEY:Nightblade Art ~ Dusk Strike							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Nightblade Art Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p8	DESC:The nightblade gains the ability to slip her weapon between dimensions, if only for a moment. By expending a shadow surge as a swift action, the nightblade’s melee, ranged, or natural weapon shifts partially into the Plane of Shadow, bypassing a target’s defenses. The next weapon or natural attack the nightblade makes resolves against touch AC, rather than the target’s normal AC. If the nightblade doesn’t make the attack before the start of her next turn, the effect is wasted. The nightblade must be at least 9th level before selecting this art.
Fall of Night		KEY:Nightblade Art ~ Fall of Night						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Nightblade Art Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p8	DESC:The nightblade can spend a shadow surge as a swift action when she confirms a critical hit to flood her target with shadowy energy. The nightblade can choose one of the following effects to inflict: blinded for 2d4 rounds, staggered for 1 round, or exhausted. A successful Fortitude save negates the effect. The nightblade must be at least 15th level before selecting this art.
Flexible Art		KEY:Nightblade Art ~ Flexible Art						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Nightblade Art Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p8	DESC:The nightblade gains a bonus feat. The nightblade must be at least 12th level before selecting this art.
Focused Cast		KEY:Nightblade Art ~ Focused Cast						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Nightblade Art Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p8	DESC:The nightblade can expend a shadow surge as a free action to take 10 on a concentration check, even if circumstances would normally prevent her from taking 10 on a check.
Hidden Stride		KEY:Nightblade Art ~ Hidden Stride						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Nightblade Art Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.9	DESC:The nightblade can move at full speed while using the Stealth skill without penalty. When in dim light, the miss chance due to concealment against the nightblade increases to 50% (rather than 20%); this does not grant total concealment, it just increases the miss chance.
Mystic Shade		KEY:Nightblade Art ~ Mystic Shade						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Nightblade Art Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.9	DESC:The nightblade can use her shadow magic to better emulate the abilities needed to activate wands, scrolls, and the like. The nightblade can expend a shadow surge as a free action when making a Use Magic Device check to roll twice on the check and take the better result.
Penumbral Aegis		KEY:Nightblade Art ~ Penumbral Aegis						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Nightblade Art Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.9	DESC:The nightblade can use shadowstuff to redirect attacks that would normally bypass her defenses. The nightblade adds her Charisma modifier (minimum +0) as a bonus to her touch AC. This cannot make her touch AC exceed her normal AC. The nightblade must be at least 12th level before selecting this art.
Shadow Cache		KEY:Nightblade Art ~ Shadow Cache						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Nightblade Art Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike		SOURCEPAGE:p.9	DESC:The nightblade can carve out a space in the Plane of Shadow to hide her belongings. This functions as the spell secret chest, using the nightblade’s level as her caster level. Unlike with secret chest, the chest is made of shadowstuff (meaning it does not cost anything) and lasts until the nightblade either dismisses the cache or is killed. Creating, hiding, and summoning the chest can be done at will without a focus as a fullround action. Creatures cannot stay in the shadow cache; if a creature is inside the chest when it is sent back to the Plane of Shadow, the creature is left behind. The nightblade can only maintain one shadow cache. If she dismisses the shadow cache or is killed while the chest is still on the Plane of Shadow, the items in the chest remain there, and cannot be recalled by any means, even by creating another shadow cache. A planar expedition to the Plane of Shadow can be made to find the chest. The nightblade must be at least 9th level before selecting this art.
Shadow Form			KEY:Nightblade Art ~ Shadow Form							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Nightblade Art Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike		SOURCEPAGE:p.9	DESC:The nightblade can turn herself into a natural shadow, as the spell shadow form*, for a number of minutes per day equal to half her nightblade level. This duration does not have to be consecutive, but must be spent in 1-minute increments. The nightblade must be at least 9th level before selecting this art.
Shadow Motion		KEY:Nightblade Art ~ Shadow Motion						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Nightblade Art Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.9	DESC:The nightblade can bend the space she is in by partially moving into the Plane of Shadow. This allows her to spend a shadow surge as a free action when making an Acrobatics, Climb, or Swim check to roll twice and take the better result.
Shadow Run			KEY:Nightblade Art ~ Shadow Run							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Nightblade Art Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike		SOURCEPAGE:p.9	DESC:The nightblade’s legs become shadowy wisps that bend and flow around the terrain. As a swift action, the nightblade can spend a shadow surge to gain the benefits of feather stepAPG for a number of rounds equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1). In addition, the nightblade adds her Charisma modifier to her CMD against attempts to trip, bull rush, reposition, or otherwise move her from her current space for the duration. Other penalties associated with moving over difficult terrain (such as damage) still apply. The nightblade must be at least 6th level before selecting this art.
Shadow Transference	KEY:Nightblade Art ~ Shadow Transference					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Nightblade Art Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.9	DESC:The nightblade can manipulate shadow magic effects after they have been created, even those created by others. By expending a shadow surge as a standard action, the nightblade can adjust the target of an ongoing spell with the darkness or shadow descriptor or of the shadow subschool. She can shift the spell to another valid target within 10 feet of the original target. If the spell was cast by another creature, the original caster is entitled to a Will save to prevent the nightblade from transferring the spell. The shadow surge is still spent, whether the transference was successful or not. Spell resistance and saving throws apply to the new target of the spell (if applicable). The spell uses its original DC and caster level (regardless of its source), but caster level checks to overcome spell resistance always use the nightblade’s caster level. The nightblade cannot use shadow transference on a spell with a range of “personal” or a spell that does not target one or more creatures or objects, and can only attempt to use it once on a single effect. The nightblade must be at least 9th level before selecting this art.
Shifting Focus		KEY:Nightblade Art ~ Shifting Focus						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Nightblade Art Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.9	DESC:The nightblade can shift an extra 100 feet each day using her shadow shift ability. The nightblade can also take other willing creatures that are adjacent to her with her when she shadow shifts. She must spend an equal amount of distance for each creature brought along. The nightblade must be at least 12th level before selecting this art.
Void Sight			KEY:Nightblade Art ~ Void Sight							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Nightblade Art Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike		SOURCEPAGE:p.9	DESC:The nightblade can grant others the ability to see in even the darkest of shadows. As a standard action, the nightblade can grant willing creatures within 30 feet the benefits of both an eyes of the voidACG spell and a see invisibility spell, using the nightblade’s level as her caster level for each effect. The nightblade can affect one willing creature per three nightblade levels she has, to a maximum of 6 creatures. The nightblade can use this ability once per day. The nightblade must be at least 15th level before selecting this art.
Warp Strike			KEY:Nightblade Art ~ Warp Strike							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Nightblade Art Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.9	DESC:The nightblade can shift her weapon into the Plane of Shadows, distorting the distance between herself and her target. By expending a shadow surge as a swift action, all of her melee weapon attacks or natural attacks made during her turn have their reach increased by 5 feet. At 12th level, the range increases to 10 feet. She may also perform this with a single melee touch attack made on her turn. Alternatively, she can spend her shadow surge as a swift action to reduce the penalty on ranged attack rolls due to distance by 2 until the end of her turn. At 12th level, the penalty is reduced by an additional 2.

###Block: Nightblade Paths
Path of the Bloodied Chain		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Nightblade Path.SpecialQuality	DESC:Those who follow the Bloodied Chain learn to harness the primal fear of darkness, overwhelming and terrifying their foes with shadows. Many of their powers are based on kytons, the sadomasochistic devils of the Plane of Shadow that relish in the pain and fear they inflict.
# Path of the Bloodied Chain
Path Power			KEY:Path of the Bloodied Chain ~ Path Power							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Path of the Bloodied Chain Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.11	DESC:A nightblade that follows the Path of the Bloodied Chain gains the following path power.
Umbral Shackles		KEY:Path of the Bloodied Chain ~ Umbral Shackles						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Path of the Bloodied Chain Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike		SOURCEPAGE:p.11	DESC:You conjure an area of fearsome shadows, entangling chains of darkness terrorizing those within. Shadowy chains twist out from a point in space you designate within 50 feet in a 10-foot radius spread. At 8th level and again at 16th level, the maximum radius of umbral shackles increases by 10 feet. You can make the radius of the umbral shackles smaller than these amounts, though the radius must be a multiple of 5 feet. The umbral shackles lower the light level in the area as a darkness spell. Creatures within the area are entangled as the chains pull at them (no save), though they are not anchored and can still move at half speed. In addition, creatures that enter the area of your umbral shackles or start their turn in the area must make a Will save or become shaken. This effect does not stack. At 6th level, creatures that are shaken that enter the area of the umbral shackles or start their turn in the area must make a Will save or become frightened. At 12th level, creatures that are frightened that enter the area of the umbral shackles or start their turn in the area must make a Will save or become panicked. The fear effects last as long as the creature remains in the area and for 1d4 rounds after they leave. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. Creatures immune to fear are immune to both the entanglement and fear effects. You are immune to the effects of your own umbral shackles (though the area is still dark to you, as the darkness spell). Umbral shackles lasts a number of rounds equal to 3 + 1/2 your nightblade level and can be dismissed early as a standard action. You can have multiple umbral shackles effects active at the same time; overlapping areas do not stack nor cause any additional effects.
Surge Ability		KEY:Path of the Bloodied Chain ~ Surge Ability						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Path of the Bloodied Chain Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.11	DESC:A nightblade of 2nd level that follows the Path of the Bloodied Chain gains the following ability to use with her shadow surge class feature.
Haunting Rattle		KEY:Path of the Bloodied Chain ~ Haunting Rattle						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Path of the Bloodied Chain Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.11	DESC:As a move action, you can spend a shadow surge to create a phantom sound of rattling chains. Any enemies within 30 feet that are currently shaken, frightened, or panicked hear this illusory sound (other creatures cannot hear it) and have the duration of those conditions increased by 1 round. This is a mindaffecting fear effect.
Path Techniques		KEY:Path of the Bloodied Chain ~ Path Techniques						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Path of the Bloodied Chain Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.11	DESC:You become more adept at using shadow magic to sow terror on the battlefield.
Frightening Display	KEY:Path of the Bloodied Chain ~ Frightening Display					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Path of the Bloodied Chain Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.11	DESC:At 1st level, you gain a bonus on Intimidate checks equal to half your nightblade level (minimum +1). If you manage to make a creature shaken for 4 or more rounds using the Intimidate skill, you can choose instead to make it frightened for 1 round for every 4 rounds it would have been shaken.
Aura of Fear		KEY:Path of the Bloodied Chain ~ Aura of Fear						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Path of the Bloodied Chain Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.11	DESC:At 5th level, you radiate a palpably daunting aura that causes all enemies within 10 feet to take a –4 penalty on saving throws against fear effects. Creatures that are normally immune to fear lose that immunity while within 10 feet of you. This ability functions only while you remain conscious, not if you are unconscious or dead.
Thrive on Fear		KEY:Path of the Bloodied Chain ~ Thrive on Fear						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Path of the Bloodied Chain Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.11	DESC:At 10th level, you become immune to fear effects, and gain a +2 bonus on saving throws against spells and effects with the pain or emotion descriptor. As long as there is at least one enemy within 50 feet of you that is suffering from a fear effect, you gain a +1 morale bonus on saving throws. This bonus increases to +2 at 18th level.
Eyes of Terror		KEY:Path of the Bloodied Chain ~ Eyes of Terror						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Path of the Bloodied Chain Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.11	DESC:At 15th level, you gain a gaze attack with a range of 30 feet that incites pure terror in those that see it. A creature that is subjected to your gaze attack must make a Will save or be staggered for 1 round, overwhelmed with fear. A creature with Hit Dice less than half your nightblade level is paralyzed for 1d4 rounds instead. Starting or ending your gaze attack is a standard action. You can use your gaze attack for a number of rounds per day equal to 1/2 your nightblade level. These rounds do not need to be consecutive. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.
Shadow of Dread		KEY:Path of the Bloodied Chain ~ Shadow of Dread						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Path of the Bloodied Chain Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.11	DESC:At 20th level, you become terror incarnate. You are immune to bleed effects and to spells and effects with the pain or emotion descriptor (unless you allow them to affect you). For each creature within 50 feet that is suffering from a fear effect, you gain fast healing 1; this fast healing stacks, up to fast healing 10. Once per day, you can cast weird as a spell-like ability, using your nightblade level as your caster level.

Bloodied Chains		KEY:Path of the Bloodied Chain ~ Bloodied Chains						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Path of the Bloodied Chain Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.11	DESC:The chains within the nightblade’s umbral shackles become wickedly barbed. Any creature inside takes 1d6 points of bleed damage each round; this damage does not stack. The bleeding persists even after the creature leaves the area of umbral shackles, though it can be stopped or healed as normal. At 15th level, the bleed effect increases to 2d6 damage. A creature that is immune to fear is immune to the bleed effect. The nightblade is immune to the bleeding effect of her umbral shackles. The nightblade must be at least 9th level before selecting this art.
Dread Sense			KEY:Path of the Bloodied Chain ~ Dread Sense							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Path of the Bloodied Chain Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.11	DESC:The nightblade gains the ability to detect scared creatures simply by being near them, even if she cannot see them. She gains blindsight out to 60 feet, but it only allows her to perceive creatures that are suffering from a fear effect. The nightblade must be at least 12th level before selecting this art.
Shroud of Chains		KEY:Path of the Bloodied Chain ~ Shroud of Chains						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Path of the Bloodied Chain Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike		SOURCEPAGE:p.12	DESC:The nightblade can make the shadowy chains of her umbral shackles emerge from herself to terrorize foes that draw near. By spending two of her daily uses of umbral shackles, she can cause the effect to be centered on herself. The area of the umbral shackles stays centered on her for the entire duration, even if she moves. The nightblade can also adjust the size of this shroud as a move action from as small as a 5-foot radius up to its normal size, though the radius must be a multiple of 5 feet. The nightblade must be at least 15th level before selecting this art.

Path Power			KEY:Path of the Darkened Fortress ~ Path Power							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Path of the Darkened Fortress Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.12	DESC:A nightblade that follows the Path of the Darkened Fortress gains the following path power.
Shadow Armament		KEY:Path of the Darkened Fortress ~ Shadow Armament						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Path of the Darkened Fortress Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike		SOURCEPAGE:p.12	DESC:You can create a weapon made out of shadowstuff. The weapon must be a melee weapon you are proficient with. Being made of shadowstuff, the weapon is only partially real; creatures that realize the weapon is not real are less affected by it. When you first attack a creature with the armament, it is entitled to a Will save to realize the weapon isn’t real. On a successful save, the weapon deals half damage to the target for the duration of the armament. A creature only gets one saving throw, regardless of how often you strike the creature. At 1st level, the weapon created has a +1 enhancement bonus. For every three levels after 1st, the total enhancement of the weapon increases by 1, to a total enhancement of +7 at 19th level. The weapon cannot have an enhancement bonus higher than +5 (as with a normal weapon). At 4th level, these bonuses can be used to add any of the following weapon properties: blindstrike*, frost, ghost touch, icy burst, keen, necrotic*, necrotic burst*, ominous, vorpal, and wounding. These properties do not function on a creature that makes its Will save. Adding these properties consumes an amount of bonus equal to the property’s base price modifier. Duplicate abilities do not stack. The armament must be given at least a +1 enhancement bonus before any other properties can be added. These bonuses and properties are decided when the armament is created and cannot be changed until the next time you use this power. Creating a shadow armament is a move action and lasts for a number of minutes equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1). As long as the armament’s duration lasts, you can “stow” and “draw” the weapon by dispersing and rematerializing the weapon. This takes the same amount of time it takes for you to draw or sheathe a normal weapon, including any reductions in time from feats and abilities such as Quick Draw. If you are ever disarmed of the armament or you throw it (as a thrown weapon) you can rematerialize the same weapon as if you were drawing it. You can only have one shadow armament in existence at a time. If you use the power again, the previous armament vanishes.
Surge Ability		KEY:Path of the Darkened Fortress ~ Surge Ability						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Path of the Darkened Fortress Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.12	DESC:A nightblade of 2nd level that follows the Path of the Darkened Fortress gains the following ability to use with her shadow surge class feature.
Shadow Barrier		KEY:Path of the Darkened Fortress ~ Shadow Barrier						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Path of the Darkened Fortress Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.12	DESC:As an immediate action, you can expend a shadow surge to turn your shadow into a solid barrier. The barrier grants you cover versus a single enemy against the next attack or spell it uses against you, giving you a +4 bonus to Armor Class and a +2 bonus on Reflex saving throws. After a single attack is made, whether it hits or not, the barrier vanishes. At 10th level, the barrier instead lasts until the start of your next turn, granting you cover against all attacks and spells used against you by a single opponent during that time.
Path Techniques		KEY:Path of the Darkened Fortress ~ Path Techniques						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Path of the Darkened Fortress Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.12	DESC:Your mastery over shadow creation is unparalleled.
Shadow Bond			KEY:Path of the Darkened Fortress ~ Shadow Bond							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Path of the Darkened Fortress Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.12	DESC:At 1st level, you gain an arcane bond, as a wizard equal to your nightblade level. In the case of a bonded object, the object allows you to cast any one spell you know once per day, as opposed to a spell in a spellbook. Your nightblade levels stack with any other class levels that grant an arcane bond when determining the powers of your arcane bond. This ability does not allow you to have both a bonded object and a familiar. Unlike most arcane bonds, your familiar or bonded object can meld with your shadow. Melding your bonded object into your shadow or turning it back to a normal item is equivalent to drawing or stowing that object as appropriate (typically a move action) and appears in the appropriate place when manifested, such as around your neck for a bonded necklace or in your hands for a bonded weapon. Melding with your shadow or turning back to familiar form is a move action for your familiar. When melded with your shadow, the familiar does not count as a creature separate from you. It continues to grant its special familiar ability while melded, but otherwise has no abilities and can take no actions except to transform from shadow into creature. It cannot be targeted by effects or spells, nor do spells that target you benefit or harm the familiar while it is melded. A bonded object that is melded cannot be targeted by effects, nor stolen, sundered, and so on, but is considered held or worn for the purpose of casting spells. A bonded object that is melded with your shadow continues to grant any passive benefits the object would grant when worn or held, such as the deflection bonus to AC from a ring of protection, but you cannot use any spell-trigger, activated, or command word abilities the object may have. You cannot use another magic item that occupies the same slot as a melded bonded object; if you do, the worn item takes precedence and the bonuses from the bonded object are negated (though you can still cast spells as if you were holding or wearing your bonded object).
Penumbral Craft		KEY:Path of the Darkened Fortress ~ Penumbral Craft						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Path of the Darkened Fortress Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.13	DESC:At 5th level, you gain your choice of either Craft Magic Arms and Armor or Craft Wondrous Item as a bonus feat. Additionally, when you craft a magic item (except a potion, a spell-trigger item, or a spell-completion item) you may utilize shadow magic to replicate the required spells, letting you ignore one spell prerequisite without increasing the creation DC. You can ignore an additional spell prerequisite at 10th, 15th, and 20th levels.
Guardian Shroud		KEY:Path of the Darkened Fortress ~ Guardian Shroud						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Path of the Darkened Fortress Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.13	DESC:At 10th level, you can reflexively cause shadows to coalesce about you, hardening to deflect deadly blows. You have a 25% chance of ignoring any critical hit or sneak attack used against you. This chance increases to 50% at 13th level.
Dark Citadel		KEY:Path of the Darkened Fortress ~ Dark Citadel						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Path of the Darkened Fortress Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike		SOURCEPAGE:p.13	DESC:At 15th level, you gain access to your own pocket dimension within the Plane of Shadow, forming as a private fortress for you and your allies. This functions as a permanent create demiplaneUM spell, using your nightblade level as your caster level. You can choose the general features of the demiplane as described in create demiplaneUM. Within the center of the demiplane is a mighty fortress, as the “structure” option of the create demiplaneUM spell; the fortress can be any shape and layout you desire, but cannot exceed half of the demiplane’s total space (at 15th caster level, this is 75 10-ft. cubes of space). The interior of the fortress is protected by powerful abjurations, as a guards and wards spell, using your nightblade level as your caster level. You decide what protections the guards and wards spell provides (within the limitations of the spell), can change what defenses are granted once every 24 hours, and can dismiss or reactivate the guards and wards as a full-round action while you are in the demiplane. Twice per day, you may teleport yourself and your allies to the dark citadel or from the citadel to where you came from as if casting a plane shift spell. As it is in the Plane of Shadow, a creature cannot travel to your demiplane using etherealness or astral projection as with a normal demiplane, but it can be accessed via a shadow walk or plane shift spell. The size of the demiplane and the fortress itself scales with your nightblade level (up to 200 10-ft. cubes of space at 20th nightblade level for the entire plane, and up to 100 10-ft. cubes of space for the fortress); you choose the form of the additional space as you gain it. If the demiplane or the guards and wards effect within the plane are ever dispelled, it returns after 1 week (though any items stored in the demiplane are lost if the whole plane was dispelled). You may add to the demiplane as normal by using other castings of create demiplaneUM and its lesser and greater variants, but these additions are not permanent unless a permanency spell is cast on each addition. Even if this is done, if the whole plane is dispelled only the original demiplane returns; any additions you may have added to the plane do not return.
Shadow Raiment		KEY:Path of the Darkened Fortress ~ Shadow Raiment						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Path of the Darkened Fortress Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.13	DESC:At 20th level, your control over shadow creation lets you create a constant barrier of darkness to defend yourself. You gain DR 5/silver and immunity to sneak attacks and critical hits. In dim light, darkness, or supernatural darkness, your damage reduction increases to DR 10/silver.
Nightblade Arts		KEY:Path of the Darkened Fortress ~ Nightblade Arts						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Path of the Darkened Fortress Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.13	DESC:A nightblade that follows the Path of the Darkened Fortress can select from the following nightblade arts.
Dark Enchantment		KEY:Path of the Darkened Fortress ~ Dark Enchantment						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Path of the Darkened Fortress Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.13	DESC:The enhancements for the nightblade’s shadow armament become more flexible. The nightblade adds corrosive, corrosive burst, fiery burst, flaming, shocking, shocking burst, and thundering to the list of bonuses she can apply to her armament. The nightblade also gains the ability to shroud her armament over a real weapon she is proficient with. This grants the real weapon the benefits of an illusory edge* spell, using her nightblade level as her caster level, but only while the nightblade uses the weapon. The nightblade can choose any bonus she can grant her shadow armament, rather than the bonuses listed for illusory edge*, though the total enhancement bonus she can grant is still limited as described in the illusory edge* spell. The nightblade can only enhance a weapon in this manner if she can create an armament of the same type (typically a melee weapon, but can be used on ranged weapons if she possesses the versatile armament art). Enhancing a real weapon in this manner takes a single daily use of her shadow armament. The nightblade must be at least 9th level before selecting this art.
Improved Shadow Bond	KEY:Path of the Darkened Fortress ~ Improved Shadow Bond					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Path of the Darkened Fortress Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.13	DESC:The nightblade’s shadow bond gains additional power. The type of bonus depends on the form of her shadow bond. If the nightblade has a familiar, she gains the Improved Familiar feat as a bonus feat. When the nightblade reaches 9th level, her familiar gains the benefit of her hide in plain sight class feature, but only as long as the familiar is within 5 feet of the nightblade. If the nightblade has a bonded object, the nightblade adds her Charisma modifier to her CMD to resist attempts to sunder, disarm, steal, or otherwise attack her bonded object. She also adds her Charisma modifier to any saving throws the bonded object makes. In addition, the nightblade can use the hand holding her bonded object to perform gestures for the somatic components of her spells. At 9th level, her bonded object can be used to cast an additional spell that she knows each day, and enchanting her arcane bond using item creation feats costs 10% less gold than normal. The nightblade must be at least 6th level before selecting this art.
Piercing Armament		KEY:Path of the Darkened Fortress ~ Piercing Armament						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Path of the Darkened Fortress Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.14	DESC:The nightblade’s armament can pierce even the toughest of defenses. Creatures that make the saving throw to disbelieve the shadow armament still take full effect from the weapon for 1 round as if they had failed the Will save. This effect does not apply to real weapons enhanced by the nightblade’s dark enchantment art (if she has it). The nightblade must be at least 15th level before selecting this art.
Shadow Equipment		KEY:Path of the Darkened Fortress ~ Shadow Equipment						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Path of the Darkened Fortress Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.14	DESC:The nightblade can spend a shadow surge as a standard action to create a quasireal object that weighs no more than 1 pound per nightblade level she possesses. The created gear is not truly real; a creature affected by any equipment made by the nightblade is entitled to a Will save to disbelieve the item, treating it as if it doesn’t exist. The equipment remains for 1 minute per nightblade level before fading away, although it disappears after one round if it leaves the nightblade’s possession. Creating equipment to an exact specification might require a Craft skill check, subject to GM discretion. The shadowstuff can replicate simple materials, such as wood, stone, glass, or metal, but it cannot contain any moving parts. The nightblade could use this ability to create a dagger or a rope, but not a flask of acid. Any created equipment is mundane, non-masterwork and cannot be magically enhanced by any means.
Versatile Armament	KEY:Path of the Darkened Fortress ~ Versatile Armament					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Path of the Darkened Fortress Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.14	DESC:The nightblade gains new ways to shape her shadow armament. This grants two new forms: dual weapons, and ranged weapons. The nightblade can create two melee weapons she is proficient with, one in each hand, rather than just one. These do not have to be the same weapon. They must be appropriately sized for the nightblade to wield. When she creates two weapons, the total enhancement bonus she can apply to her shadow armament is lowered by 2 (minimum +0), but both weapons receive the bonuses. Both weapons must be given the same enhancements; if one of the chosen weapon properties can be applied to one of her weapons and not the other, the bonus does not function on the incompatible weapon. A creature only gets its Will save once against the weapons; a successful save makes the creature realize both weapons are not real. The nightblade can also create her armament in the form of a ranged weapon she is proficient with. When she does so, she also gains a replenishing supply of shadowy ammunition. The ammunition is typical of the weapon and has no special material or alchemical properties; it could take the form of a bullet or arrow, but not an alchemical cartridge or silver bolt. This ammunition can only be used with the nightblade’s shadow armament. A creature only gets its Will save once against the ammunition; a successful save makes the creature realize all of the ammunition is not real. Real ammunition cannot be used with the shadow armament; it simply falls through the weapon. The weapon is loaded when created, if required. Instead of its normal enhancements, a ranged shadow armament gains the following properties for its ammunition at 4th level: blindstrike*, brilliant energy, designating, frost, greater designating, ghost touch, icy burst, necrotic*, necrotic burst*, and seeking. These effects do not function against a creature that makes its Will save.


Path of the Eternal Night		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Nightblade Path.SpecialQuality	DESC:The Path of the Eternal Night teaches how to bring enemies to the final embrace of death. Nightblades on this path utilize powerful negative energy, death, and entropic effects to corrupt their foes. Their strength comes from the destructive void between the Plane of Shadow and the Plane of Negative Energy, where existence is twisted into oblivion and horrible undead nightshades plot the annihilation of all.
# Path of the Eternal Night
Path Power			KEY:Path of the Eternal Night ~ Path Power							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Path of the Eternal Night Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.14	DESC:A nightblade that follows the Path of the Eternal Night gains the following path power.
Corruption			KEY:Path of the Eternal Night ~ Corruption							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Path of the Eternal Night Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.14	DESC:You create a swirling vortex of negative energy around you, harming any that draw near. Starting a corruption is a swift action. The corruption manifests as shadowy energy that flows about you in a 5-foot radius. This energy harms any creature exposed to it, dealing 1d6 negative energy damage to any creature that enters the area or starts their turn in the area. A successful Fortitude save halves the damage. Undead in the area are not healed by this negative energy, but must instead make a Will save or flee as if panicked for 1d4 rounds. The corruption always moves with you and stays centered on your space. Creatures you move past take damage from your corruption as if they had entered the area themselves. A single creature cannot be harmed by corruption more than once per round, regardless of how many times a creature enters or exits your corruption. You are immune to the effects of your own corruption; other creatures in your space are affected as normal. The corruption lasts a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your nightblade level + your Charisma modifier (minimum 1) and can be dismissed early as a standard action. You can only have one corruption in effect at a time. At 5th level, and every four levels thereafter, the damage of your corruption increases by 1d6, to a maximum of 5d6 per round at 17th level.
Surge Ability		KEY:Path of the Eternal Night ~ Surge Ability						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Path of the Eternal Night Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.15	DESC:A nightblade of 2nd level that follows the Path of the Eternal Night gains the following ability to use with her shadow surge class feature.
Entropic Grasp		KEY:Path of the Eternal Night ~ Entropic Grasp						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Path of the Eternal Night Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike		SOURCEPAGE:p.15	DESC:By spending a shadow surge as a standard action, you can make a single touch attack against a creature to afflict it with entropic energies. For the next round, anytime the target rolls a d20, it must roll twice and take the less favorable result. Once a creature has been affected by entropic grasp, it cannot be affected again for 24 hours.
Path Techniques		KEY:Path of the Eternal Night ~ Path Techniques						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Path of the Eternal Night Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.15	DESC:The blending of shadow magic and negative energy gives you mastery over death itself.
Powered by Death		KEY:Path of the Eternal Night ~ Powered by Death						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Path of the Eternal Night Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike		SOURCEPAGE:p.15	DESC:You can absorb the life force of a dying or recently deceased creature to gain great power. As a standard action, you can target a creature within 30 feet that currently has -1 or fewer hit points or is deceased. A creature that is deceased must have died on the previous turn to be targeted by this ability. A living creature must make a Will save or be slain instantly. This is a death effect. If you successfully kill a creature with this ability, you gain one of the following benefits, chosen when the creature fails its saving throw: • +1 morale bonus on attack rolls. This increases by +1 at 6th level and every six nightblade levels thereafter (max +4). • +1 morale bonus on damage rolls. This increases by +1 for every three levels past 1st (max +7). • DR 1/magic. This increases by 1 for every four levels after 1st (max DR 5). At 10th level, this DR changes to silver. • +1 insight bonus on concentration checks and caster level checks to overcome spell resistance. This increases by 1 for every three levels after 1st (maximum +7). • Heal 1d6 hit points, plus an additional 1d6 hit points per two nightblade levels past 1st (maximum 10d6). The benefit lasts for 1 minute, except for the healing, which is instant. When you target a creature that died last turn, the creature gets no saving throw and you automatically gain one of the listed benefits. You cannot target a dead creature that you killed with this ability. At 7th level, you can use this ability as a move action. At 13th level, you can use this ability as a swift action. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1).
Descent into Darkness	KEY:Path of the Eternal Night ~ Descent into Darkness					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Path of the Eternal Night Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.15	DESC:At 5th level, you gain Diehard as a bonus feat, even if you do not meet the prerequisites. In addition, you gain an aura that balances life and death within. Allies within 10 feet of you are treated as having the Diehard feat, even if they don’t meet the prerequisites, and automatically succeed any checks to stabilize. An ally using the Diehard feat to stay conscious that moves more than 10 feet away from you immediately falls unconscious (but stable) if they do not possess the Diehard feat themselves. In addition, enemies within 10 feet of you that are dying automatically fail any checks to stabilize and cannot benefit from the Diehard feat unless they have more hit dice than your nightblade level. You have this aura only while you are conscious, not if you are unconscious or dead.
Death Attunement		KEY:Path of the Eternal Night ~ Death Attunement						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Path of the Eternal Night Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.15	DESC:At 10th level, you no longer take damage from negative energy effects. You gain a +4 bonus on saving throws against death effects and energy drain. You permanently can see the condition of living and dead creatures, as if under the effects of a deathwatch spell.
Shadow Betrayal		KEY:Path of the Eternal Night ~ Shadow Betrayal						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Path of the Eternal Night Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike		SOURCEPAGE:p.15	DESC:At 15th level, you gain the power to animate a creature’s shadow and turn it against him. As a standard action, you can cause a creature within 30 feet to have its shadow animate into a hostile creature; this is treated as a summon monster VII spell, but instead conjures a greater shadowB1. The greater shadow has superficial traits that make it appear similar to the creature it was animated from, but otherwise does not have its statistics or size changed in any way. The greater shadow can only attack the creature whose shadow it was animated from; if that creature dies, the greater shadow dies with it. The greater shadow cannot create spawn. You cannot use this ability on a creature that does not have a shadow. As long as this ability is in effect, the creature does not cast a shadow and cannot be targeted by other spells and effects that rely on having a shadow. You can use this ability once per day. At 17th level, this ability functions as summon monster VIII, allowing you to create 1d3 greater shadows. However, you may only animate one greater shadow per creature in range; the shadow can only attack whatever creature it was animated from. At 19th level, this functions as summon monster IX with the same limitations, allowing you to summon 1d4+1 greater shadows.
Master of Death		KEY:Path of the Eternal Night ~ Master of Death						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Path of the Eternal Night Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.15	DESC:At 20th level, you become one with death and entropy. You gain immunity to death effects, energy drain, sickened, nausea, fatigue, and exhaustion. You can no longer be magically aged. Negative energy effects heal you as if you were undead. Once per day, you may cast maw of the nightwave* as a spell-like ability, using your nightblade level as your caster level.

Corrupting Feast		KEY:Path of the Eternal Night ~ Corrupting Feast						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Path of the Eternal Night Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.16	DESC:The nightblade’s corruption lashes out at anyone who strikes at the nightblade, absorbing their life force. The nightblade is treated as if under the effects of a vampiric shadow shieldACG spell as long as her corruption is active. The nightblade must be at least 15th level before selecting this art.
Grasp of Death		KEY:Path of the Eternal Night ~ Grasp of Death						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Path of the Eternal Night Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.16	DESC:The deathly energies of the nightblade’s corruption linger, harming creatures even after they move away. A creature harmed by the nightblade’s corruption that leaves the area must make another save against the nightblade’s corruption at the start of its turn, as if it was still in the area of the corruption. This only occurs the first round the creature is outside of the corruption, though if it reenters and exits the area this effect will apply again. A creature can still only be harmed by corruption once per round. The nightblade must be at least 9th level before selecting this art.
Grave Walker		KEY:Path of the Eternal Night ~ Grave Walker						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Path of the Eternal Night Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.16	DESC:The nightblade gains the ability to shift between dead or dying creatures, the energy of their death serving as a focal point for her shadow magic. The nightblade can treat a corpse’s, a dying creature’s, or an undead creature’s space and any squares adjacent to it as if it were in dim light for the purpose of teleporting with her shadow shift ability. The nightblade must be at least 12th level before selecting this art.
Shadow of Death		KEY:Path of the Eternal Night ~ Shadow of Death						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Path of the Eternal Night Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.16	DESC:The nightblade can partially absorb the life force of a slain creature to fuel her shadow magic. Whenever the nightblade successfully uses her powered by death spell-like ability, she also gains a shadow surge. This surge does not count against her normal maximum of surges she can have at once, but the surge must be spent within 1 minute or it is lost.
Vile Corruption		KEY:Path of the Eternal Night ~ Vile Corruption						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Path of the Eternal Night Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.16	DESC:The nightblade’s corruption makes creatures uneasy while they remain in its area.

Elemental Shade		KEY:Path of the Ravaging Void ~ Elemental Shade						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Path of the Ravaging Void Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.16	DESC:You create an area of unstable shadow magic, forcibly replacing energy effects with shadowstuff. As a standard action, you designate a point of space within 50 feet for your elemental shade to surround. The shade emits out from that point in a 20-ft.-radius spread. Upon creating the elemental shade, you choose an energy type from acid, cold, electricity, or fire. Any magical source of energy that deals one of these types of damage with a caster level equal to or less than your nightblade level is altered to the chosen energy type. This includes supernatural effects from creatures with Hit Dice no greater than your nightblade level that deal one of these types of energy damage. You cannot change the energy type of an extraordinary ability or a mundane energy effect (such as a torch) using elemental shade. If an effect lies only partially within the elemental shade, only the portions within the shade are transformed. Elemental shade lasts a number of rounds equal to 3 + 1/4 your nightblade level and can be dismissed as a standard action. You can only have one elemental shade in effect a time. If you use this ability again, any currently existing elemental shade immediately ends. At 7th level, you can use elemental shade as a move action. At 13th level, you can use it as a swift action.
Surge Ability		KEY:Path of the Ravaging Void ~ Surge Ability						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Path of the Ravaging Void Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.16	DESC:A nightblade of 2nd level that follows the Path of the Ravaging Void gains the following ability to use with her shadow surge class feature.
Umbral Blast		KEY:Path of the Ravaging Void ~ Umbral Blast						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Path of the Ravaging Void Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike		SOURCEPAGE:p.16	DESC:You can spend a shadow surge as a standard action to unleash a chilling ray of darkness on a creature within 30 feet. You must make a ranged touch attack to strike with your umbral blast.

Path Techniques		KEY:Path of the Ravaging Void ~ Path Techniques						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Path of the Ravaging Void Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.16	DESC:Your shadow magic grants you incredible destructive power.
Warding Shadows		KEY:Path of the Ravaging Void ~ Warding Shadows						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Path of the Ravaging Void Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.16	DESC:At 1st level, you gain a shadowy aura that protects you from energy attacks, which you can eventually grant to your allies. Choose either acid, cold, electricity, or fire. Your warding shadows grant you resistance 5 against that energy type. This increases to resistance 10 at 6th level, to resistance 20 at 11th level, and to resistance 30 at 16th level. Once per day when you regain your spells, you may change the energy type that warding shadows protects against. Starting at 6th level, allies within 10 feet of you gain energy resistance to the same energy type equal to half the resistance that you gain. The ability to share your resistance with allies only functions while you are conscious, not if you are unconscious or dead.
Twisted Elements		KEY:Path of the Ravaging Void ~ Twisted Elements						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Path of the Ravaging Void Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.16	DESC:At 5th level, you can infuse your elemental spells with shadowstuff, causing the spell to gain additional effects typical of a different energy type. When you cast a spell that deals acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage, you can combine the spell with shadow magic as a swift action. This allows it to have an additional effect based on a different element, chosen from the following list. You must choose an effect based on an energy type that is different from the type of energy damage the spell inflicts: • Acid - The spell is accompanied by noxious fumes and pain, sickening a creature for 1d4 rounds. • Cold – The spell creates an abnormal chill, slowing a creature (as the slow spell) for 1 round. • Electricity – The spell creates a brilliant flash, blinding a target for 1d4 rounds. • Fire – The spell generates intense flames, setting a creature on fire. • Sonic – The spell causes a mighty thunderclap, deafening a target for 1d4 rounds. A creature that is immune to the type of energy the chosen effect is based on is immune to the added effect (for example, a creature immune to electricity cannot be blinded by this ability). Each of these effects only applies to a single target that is affected by the spell, and is negated if the creature succeeds on its saving throw against the spell. If the spell has no saving throw, the creature gets to a Fortitude save to negate this effect, the DC being equal to the DC the spell would have if it had a saving throw. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier
Shadow Energy		KEY:Path of the Ravaging Void ~ Shadow Energy						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Path of the Ravaging Void Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike		SOURCEPAGE:p.17	DESC:At 10th level, you can combine unused spell slots with shadow energy to replicate evocation spells. By using this ability, you can cast any evocation spell on the sorcerer/wizard or nightblade spell list that deals acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage, as if using shadow evocation. To do so, you must give up a number of spell slots whose total spell levels is greater than or equal to the value shown in Table: Shadow Energy for the spell level you wish to replicate. For example, if you want to replicate fireball (a 3rd level spell), you would have to give up a number of spell slots whose total levels is at least four or more. This can be any combination of spell slots, such as two 2nd level spell slots, one 4th level spell slot, or a 1st level spell slot and a 3rd level spell slot. The created effects are only 20% real (as with shadow evocation). Any saving throws for the replicated spell (and the Will save to disbelieve it) use the normal DC for the replicated spell’s level, as opposed to the DC of shadow evocation. The replicated spell gains the shadow descriptor, in addition to its normal descriptors. Casting a spell with this ability takes a full-round action, as opposed to the spell’s normal casting time; if the spell has a longer casting time than this, the spell requires its normal casting time. At 10th level, you can replicate spells up to 4th level. At 12th level, and every two levels thereafter, you can replicate spells of a level higher, up to 9th level spells at 20th level. At 16th level, the spells become 60% real, as if cast with greater shadow evocation.
Shadow Avatar		KEY:Path of the Ravaging Void ~ Shadow Avatar						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Path of the Ravaging Void Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike		SOURCEPAGE:p.17	DESC:At 15th level, you can temporarily replace your entire being with roiling shadow energy as a standard action. This functions as the spell fiery bodyAPG, using your nightblade level as your caster level, except as noted below. You and your equipment are immune to cold damage and you are healed by cold instead of by fire. The other resistances and immunities apply as normal. While you do not take additional damage from cold effects (as with fiery bodyAPG), you are affected by light-based spells such as sunburst as if you were an undead shadow. Your unarmed attack deals cold damage instead of fire damage. You do not burn brightly or dazzle creatures as with fiery bodyAPG; instead, your shadowy form gives you a +10 competence bonus on Stealth checks made in dim light or darkness. Shadow and darkness spells you cast have their save DCs increased by +1, including spells cast with your shadow energy ability, instead of fire spells. You do not take damage nor gain concealment when in water, but are staggered when in an area of bright light. You can use shadow avatar once per day.
Inevitable Darkness	KEY:Path of the Ravaging Void ~ Inevitable Darkness					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Path of the Ravaging Void Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.17	DESC:At 20th level, your magic can pierce even the toughest defenses. Whenever you cast an evocation spell or a shadow spell that replicates an evocation spell, such as shadow evocation or your shadow energy technique, you can roll twice to penetrate a creature’s spell resistance and take the better result. Abilities that reduce the effects a spell has on a successful save, such as evasion, improved evasion, or stalwart do not function and provide no benefit against such spells.
Nightblade Arts		KEY:Path of the Ravaging Void ~ Nightblade Arts						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Path of the Ravaging Void Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.17	DESC:A nightblade that follows the Path of the Ravaging Void can select from the following nightblade arts.
Destructive Shade		KEY:Path of the Ravaging Void ~ Destructive Shade						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Path of the Ravaging Void Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.17	DESC:Whenever the nightblade casts a spell that deals damage, the spell deals +1 point of damage per die rolled.
Empowered Elements	KEY:Path of the Ravaging Void ~ Empowered Elements					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Path of the Ravaging Void Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.18	DESC:The nightblade’s elemental shade can even affect the magical effects of powerful creatures. If a creature creates a magic effect inside the nightblade’s elemental shade that deals acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage that has a higher caster level than the nightblade’s level, or attempts to use a supernatural ability that deals acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage when they have more Hit Dice than the nightblade’s level, the creature must make a Will save to avoid having their magical effect changed to the energy type that was chosen with the elemental shade ability. The saving throw only applies to that single effect; if the creature creates multiple energy effects, it must make a saving throw for each effect it makes. The nightblade must be at least 9th level before selecting this art.
Encroaching Darkness	KEY:Path of the Ravaging Void ~ Encroaching Darkness					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Path of the Ravaging Void Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.18	DESC:The nightblade gains the ability to create a wider effect with her elemental shade and can do so from further away. The nightblade’s elemental shade increases in size to a 30 ft. radius, and can be created from any point in space within 100 feet.
Enter the Void		KEY:Path of the Ravaging Void ~ Enter the Void						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Path of the Ravaging Void Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.18	DESC:The nightblade’s elemental shade creates a dark void in its center, drawing enemies towards it. Creatures within the area of the nightblade’s elemental shade have their movement speed cut in half (no save). An enemy within the area of the nightblade’s elemental shade that tries to move away from the center must succeed on a bull rush combat maneuver check against a CMD of 10 + the nightblade’s level + her Charisma modifier, done as part of the move action. If it succeeds, it can move as normal (though still at half speed). On a failed save, the creature’s move action is wasted and it does not move. If the creature fails by 10 or more, it is pulled 5 feet closer to the center of the elemental shade. The nightblade must be at least 15th level before selecting this art.
Exposing Void		KEY:Path of the Ravaging Void ~ Exposing Void						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Path of the Ravaging Void Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike		SOURCEPAGE:p.18	DESC:The nightblade can expose a target to the void of darkness, making it more vulnerable. The nightblade can spend a shadow surge as a move action to make a single creature or object within 50 feet gain vulnerability to either acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage until the end of the nightblade’s next turn. A Fortitude save negates this effect. A creature or object that is immune to the selected energy type is unaffected by this ability. Whether the target makes its save or not, it cannot be subjected to this effect again for 24 hours. The nightblade must be at least 12th level before selecting this art.


Path of the Twilight Veil		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Nightblade Path.SpecialQuality	DESC:The Path of the Twilight Veil is a secretive path that uses shadow magic to distract, confuse, and deceive opponents.

Distorting Shadows	KEY:Path of the Twilight Veil ~ Distorting Shadows					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Path of the Twilight Veil Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike		SOURCEPAGE:p.18	DESC:You create an area of shifting shadows, the darkness an ever-changing pattern of shapes and shades that assault the minds of those within. As a standard action, you designate a point in space within 50 feet to conjure your distorting shadows. The distorting shadows swirl around that point in a 20-foot radius spread, affecting any creatures within or entering the area. Any creature that enters the area of your distorting shadows or starts its turn within the area must make a Will save or be affected by the shadows, which causes a random effect as shown on Table: Distorting Shadows Effects. Each creature must make this save every round they remain in the area or suffer another randomly determined effect. The Hit Dice of the creature being affected determines what effects can be applied to the creature. If the creature has less Hit Dice than 1/2 your nightblade level + 5, roll 1d8 to determine what effect is applied to it from Table: Distorting Shadows Effects. If the creature has more Hit Dice than that, roll 1d6 to determine what effect is applied to it from Table: Distorting Shadows Effects. You must roll separately for each creature affected. Distorting shadows lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + 1/4 your nightblade level. You can dismiss it early as a standard action. You are immune to the effects of your distorting shadows. Sightless creatures are unaffected by distorting shadows. This is a mindaffecting pattern effect.

Extended Illusions	KEY:Path of the Twilight Veil ~ Extended Illusions					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Path of the Twilight Veil Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.19	DESC:At 1st level, you may have any illusion spell you cast with a duration of “concentration” last a number of additional rounds equal to 1/2 your nightblade level after you stop maintaining concentration (minimum +1 round).
Illusory Arcana		KEY:Path of the Twilight Veil ~ Illusory Arcana						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Path of the Twilight Veil Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.19	DESC:At 5th level, you can add a single illusion or enchantment spell from the sorcerer/wizard spell list or the nightblade spell list to your list of spells known.

Entrancing Shadows	KEY:Path of the Twilight Veil ~ Entrancing Shadows					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Path of the Twilight Veil Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike		SOURCEPAGE:p.19	DESC:At 10th level, you can create a wall of shadowy figments and patterns to entrance creatures. This power acts as a greater wall of darkness*. However, one side of the entrancing shadows designated by you fascinates creatures within 10 feet, up to a maximum of 2 HD of creatures per nightblade level. A Will save negates the fascinate effect; the DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 your nightblade level + your Charisma modifier, as opposed to the save DC of greater wall of darkness*. You may use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to your nightblade level. These rounds do not need to be consecutive. The fascination is a mind-affecting pattern effect.
Slip Away			KEY:Path of the Twilight Veil ~ Slip Away							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Path of the Twilight Veil Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.19	DESC:At 15th level, you can vanish without a trace, causing witnesses to forget you were even there. Once per day as an immediate action, you can vanish from sight for 1 round per two nightblade levels, as the spell greater invisibility. While invisible in this way, you cannot be detected by any means, and not even invisibility purge, see invisibility, and true seeing can reveal you. In addition, creatures within 100 feet must make a Will save or forget that you were there. This functions as modify memory, though it requires no action on your part and can only make a creature forget about you (such as sounds you have made, having seen you, conversations, and so forth). The DC of the modify memory effect is equal to 10 + 1/2 your nightblade level + your Charisma modifier, as opposed to its normal DC. You can only make a creature forget details and events involving you that have occurred within the past minute. You can affect a number of creatures up to your Charisma modifier.
Master of Shadows		KEY:Path of the Twilight Veil ~ Master of Shadows						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Path of the Twilight Veil Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.19	DESC:At 20th level, your mastery over illusions is complete.

Controlled Distortion	KEY:Path of the Twilight Veil ~ Controlled Distortion					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Path of the Twilight Veil Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.19	DESC:The nightblade gains the ability to control the patterns within her distorting shadows. Once per round when determining the random effects of her distorting shadows, she can reroll the random effect that a single creature is affected with. She must do this before applying the effects of distorting shadows to that creature. The nightblade must be at least 9th level before selecting this art.
Irresistible Shade	KEY:Path of the Twilight Veil ~ Irresistible Shade					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Path of the Twilight Veil Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.19	DESC:The nightblade can create an area of illusions so powerful that even the strongest of minds cannot resist it. By spending three of her daily uses of her distorting shadows, the shadows work against all creatures, even those that are sightless or immune to mind-affecting effects. In this case, however, the shadows are even overwhelming to the nightblade; she is not immune to distorting shadows made in this manner, and she cannot make other creatures immune to it with her shade inoculation art. The nightblade must be at least 15th level before selecting this art.
Shade Inoculation		KEY:Path of the Twilight Veil ~ Shade Inoculation						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Path of the Twilight Veil Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.19	DESC:The nightblade can make her allies immune to the effects of her distorting shadows.

Shadow of Doubt		KEY:Path of the Twilight Veil ~ Shadow of Doubt						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Path of the Twilight Veil Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.19	DESC:The nightblade’s pattern effects are exceedingly potent. Each creature affected by the nightblade’s pattern spells, spell-like abilities (such as distorting shadows), or supernatural abilities is treated as if its total number of Hit Dice were equal to its number of Hit Dice minus the nightblade’s Charisma modifier (if positive) for determining the effects of those abilities. This does not stack with similar effects that reduce a creatures effective Hit Dice, such as an oracle’s awesome display revelation. The nightblade must be at least 6th level before selecting this art.
Shrouded Casting		KEY:Path of the Twilight Veil ~ Shrouded Casting						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Path of the Twilight Veil Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.19	DESC:The nightblade can use shadow magic to hide the fact she is casting a spell. By spending a shadow surge as a swift action when casting a spell, the nightblade can make a Sleight of Hand or Bluff check to hide her casting. Observers must make an opposed Perception check (if the nightblade used Sleight of Hand) or a Sense Motive check (if the nightblade used Bluff) to realize she is casting a spell. Using this ability with a spell that has a clear effect and origin, such as a burning hands spell, provides no benefit.
