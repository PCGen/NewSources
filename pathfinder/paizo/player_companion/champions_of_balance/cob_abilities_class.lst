While the negotiator performs, these targets take a -1 penalty on saving throws against enchantment (charm) and illusion (figment, glamer, or shadow) effects, as well as a penalty on Appraise checks equal to half the negotiator's level (minimum -1).

Using this ability requires 3 rounds of continuous performance, and the target must be able to see and hear the bard throughout the performance. At 18th level, this effect acts as geas/quest (no HD limit, and the target cannot attempt a saving throw). Binding contract is an enchantment (compulsion), mind-affecting, language-dependent ability that relies on audible components.

Bloodline Arcana				KEY:Impossible Bloodline ~ Bloodline Arcana							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality																																																																																																				DESC:Constructs are susceptible to your enchantment (compulsion) spells as if they were not mindaffecting.

SOURCEPAGE:p.21
Disorienting Touch			KEY:Impossible Bloodline ~ Disorienting Touch							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.SpellLike																																																																																																			DESC:As a melee touch attack, you can cause a creature to doubt its sense of depth and direction. The target is sickened for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your sorcerer level (minimum 1). Multiple touches do not stack, but they do add to the duration. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.21
Spontaneous Generation			KEY:Impossible Bloodline ~ Spontaneous Generation						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality																																																																																																				DESC:You gain Craft Wondrous Item as a bonus feat.

You can ignore an additional spell prerequisite at 9th, 15th, and 20th levels.

Distracting Pattern			KEY:Impossible Bloodline ~ Distracting Pattern							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																																		DESC:You can distort the scenery around you for a number of rounds equal to your sorcerer level. This ability provides a 20% miss chance on ranged attacks made against you and grants you a bonus on Stealth checks equal to 1/2 your sorcerer level. You can use this ability once per day at 9th level, twice per day at 17th level, and three times per day at 20th level.

Relativity					KEY:Impossible Bloodline ~ Relativity								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																																		DESC:You can traverse vertical surfaces as easily as you walk on the ground. When climbing, you move at your normal land speed and take none of the penalties associated with climbing. The surface must be able to support your weight, and difficult terrain affects your speed as normal. You are also immune to reverse 9ravity and similar effects.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.21
Living Paradox				KEY:Impossible Bloodline ~ Living Paradox								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																																		DESC:Your outward appearance remains the same, but beneath your skin lies not flesh and blood but clockwork gears, miniature galaxies, or something equally uncanny.

You take no additional damage from bleed effects, critical hits, and sneak attacks.
