In order to do so, the barbarian must confirm a critical hit against an opponent with a natural attack or unarmed strike. The barbarian deals damage as normal for a critical hit and the opponent must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + i/2 the barbarian's class level+ the barbarian's Strength modifier) or take id4 points of Constitution damage as one of its vital organs is ripped free from its body.

After successfully ripping out a creature's vital organ, the barbarian may eat the organ within i minute of extracting it as a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. Once the organ is consumed, the barbarian recovers a number of hit points equal to the Hit Dice of the organ's owner. In addition, the barbarian gains any energy immunities or resistances the victim had, though the effectiveness of these resistances is halved (for instance, a barbarian who eats the heart of a creature with resist cold 10 would gain resist cold 5; energy immunities are reduced to resist energy 20). This energy resistance lasts for a number of rounds equal to half the Hit Dice of the creature whose organ was consumed. A barbarian must have the bloody fist rage power to select this rage power. A barbarian must be at least 14th level to select this rage power.	SOURCEPAGE:p.8

###Block: Ranger Traps

Anchoring Trap*			KEY:Ranger Trap ~ Anchoring Trap		SORTKEY:Trap Anchoring			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RangerClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.RangerTrap.RangerTrapAddon.Supernatural	DESC:This trap can be added to a supernatural snare trap. The trap briefly imprisons any called creature for 1d4 rounds (Will negates). During this time the creature may not move from the location of the trap, though it may still use ranged effects and attack any creature within its reach. Additionally, anchoring traps disable the creature's ability to travel within or between dimensions. The trap does not prevent the creature from using magic items that produce these effects. The trap can hold up to a Medium creature; each extra daily use of the ranger's trap ability spent when the trap is set increases the maximum size of creature the trap can hold by one size category.																						SOURCEPAGE:p.11
Telepathy Trap			KEY:Ranger Trap ~ Telepathy Trap		SORTKEY:Trap Telepathy			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RangerClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.RangerTrap.Supernatural				DESC:The trap resonates at a high-pitched frequency audible only to creatures that communicate via telepathy. If the triggering creature has the ability to communicate via telepathy, the creature becomes overwhelmed by psychic feedback. The trapped creature is staggered for 1d4 rounds (Will negates), and may not communicate telepathically during this time. This is a sonic, mind-affecting effect. Creatures that lack telepathy are not affected by this trap, though they may still trigger it.																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.11

After having been transported, the creature may not take any other actions until its next turn. If one part of a pair of transpositional traps becomes blocked by a solid body or object, the trap does not function until the obstruction is removed. In order to create this trap, a ranger must set up two transpositional traps within 400 feet of each other, thus expending 2 uses of the ranger's traps per day. A ranger can only have one pair of transpositional traps set at a time; setting a third transpositional trap immediately causes the first to disappear and keys the second and third transpositional traps to one another.
