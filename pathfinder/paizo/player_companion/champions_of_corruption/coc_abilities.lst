You gain a +1 trait bonus on initiative and Intimidate checks.			BONUS:SKILL|Intimidate|1|TYPE=Trait			BONUS:COMBAT|INITIATIVE|1|TYPE=Trait
Detect Disobedience			KEY:Trait ~ Detect Disobedience				CATEGORY:Special Ability		TYPE:Trait.BasicTrait.SocialTrait			PREMULT:1,[PREVAREQ:BypassTraitRestriction,1],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.SocialTrait],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Trait ~ Detect Disobedience]														SOURCEPAGE:p.7			DESC:You have an uncanny ability to spot a mutiny brewing. You gain a +2 trait bonus on Sense Motive checks to detect when an underling is trying to hide something from you, and can attempt such checks instead of Perception checks to notice and react to a subordinate's surprise attack against you.
Horrifying Mind				KEY:Trait ~ Horrifying Mind					CATEGORY:Special Ability		TYPE:Trait.BasicTrait.MagicTrait			PREMULT:1,[PREVAREQ:BypassTraitRestriction,1],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.MagicTrait],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Trait ~ Horrifying Mind]															SOURCEPAGE:p.9			DESC:When a nonevil humanoid attempts to read your mind via a magical effect, the reader must attempt a Will save opposed by your Wisdom or Charisma check (your choice). If the reader fails this save, she is shaken for 1 round. If she fails by 10 or more, she is instead frightened for 1 round, then shaken for 1 round.
Passionate Inertia			KEY:Trait ~ Passionate Inertia				CATEGORY:Special Ability		TYPE:Trait.BasicTrait.SocialTrait			PREMULT:1,[PREVAREQ:BypassTraitRestriction,1],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.SocialTrait],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Trait ~ Passionate Inertia]														SOURCEPAGE:p.11			DESC:Your passions drive your thinking so irresistibly that even magic struggles to change your mind. You gain a +2 trait bonus on Will saves to resist having your mind changed about something, but you take a –1 penalty on Will saves to resist temptation and compulsions you might reasonably be already inclined toward.
Punish Insurrection			KEY:Trait ~ Punish Insurrection				CATEGORY:Special Ability		TYPE:Trait.BasicTrait.CombatTrait			PREMULT:1,[PREVAREQ:BypassTraitRestriction,1],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.CombatTrait],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Trait ~ Punish Insurrection]														SOURCEPAGE:p.7			DESC:You relish reminding people who's in charge. Against members of the same organization or hierarchy who formally answer to you, you gain a +1 trait bonus on attack and damage rolls. You also gain this bonus against members who have openly defied the authority or rules of that body, provided the infraction is serious enough that their standing is now less than yours.
Subjective Truth			KEY:Trait ~ Subjective Truth				CATEGORY:Special Ability		TYPE:Trait.BasicTrait.SocialTrait			PREMULT:1,[PREVAREQ:BypassTraitRestriction,1],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.SocialTrait],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Trait ~ Subjective Truth]														SOURCEPAGE:p.9			DESC:You are able to divorce your knowledge of the facts from your beliefs about the truth, and thus from your facial expressions and body language. You gain a +2 trait bonus on Bluff checks to lie, provided the person you're lying to has never known you to lie to him. Failing this check counts as being caught in a lie by the target, negating any future use of this bonus against that person.
Wicked Leader				KEY:Trait ~ Wicked Leader					CATEGORY:Special Ability		TYPE:Trait.BasicTrait.SocialTrait			PREMULT:1,[PREVAREQ:BypassTraitRestriction,1],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.SocialTrait],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Trait ~ Wicked Leader]															SOURCEPAGE:p.12			DESC:You gain a +1 trait bonus on Charisma checks against evil creatures. If you select the Leadership feat or the Vile Leadership feat at any point when you meet the prerequisites for that feat, you can recruit a cohort who is up to 1 level lower than you (instead of the normal requirement that your cohort must be 2 or more levels lower than you are) as long as your cohort is evil.

Divine Deceiver				KEY:Trait ~ Divine Deceiver					CATEGORY:Special Ability		TYPE:Trait.RegionalTrait					PREMULT:1,[PREVAREQ:BypassTraitRestriction,1],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.RegionalTrait],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Trait ~ Divine Deceiver]				PREREGION:Razmiran						SOURCEPAGE:p.13			DESC:You are trained in the methods of Razmir's priesthood, and can use your arcana to fuel minor healing powers. Once per day as a fullround action, you can sacrifice a prepared arcane spell or spell slot to manifest healing magic. This acts as cure light wounds, except you heal 1d6 points of damage per level of the spell or spell slot sacrificed (maximum 5d6) and the hit points healed are temporary (lasting 1 hour).
Obsequious Morsel			KEY:Trait ~ Obsequious Morsel				CATEGORY:Special Ability		TYPE:Trait.RegionalTrait					PREMULT:1,[PREVAREQ:BypassTraitRestriction,1],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.RegionalTrait],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Trait ~ Obsequious Morsel]				PREREGION:Geb							SOURCEPAGE:p.12			DESC:Once per day as a swift action, you can use sanctuary as a spell-like ability (caster level = your highest caster level, or 1st if you have no caster level), with a DC equal to 10 + 1/2 your caster level (minimum 0) + your Charisma modifier. Only undead must save to attack you (other creature types are not affected). The effect ends as soon as you attack a creature, as normal.
Shadowsight					KEY:Trait ~ Shadowsight						CATEGORY:Special Ability		TYPE:Trait.RegionalTrait					PREMULT:1,[PREVAREQ:BypassTraitRestriction,1],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.RegionalTrait],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Trait ~ Shadowsight]					PREREGION:Nidal							SOURCEPAGE:p.13			DESC:Your people's ancient compact with Zon-Kuthon manifests strongly in you. While the darkness remains fearsome, you can at least see what lurks there. As a swift action once per day, your eyes can pierce the surrounding darkness—you gain the benefit of lowlight vision for a number of rounds equal to your level.
Social Slaver				KEY:Trait ~ Social Slaver					CATEGORY:Special Ability		TYPE:Trait.RegionalTrait					PREMULT:1,[PREVAREQ:BypassTraitRestriction,1],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.RegionalTrait],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Trait ~ Social Slaver]					PREREGION:Cheliax						SOURCEPAGE:p.12			DESC:Your upbringing has accustomed you to commanding those you deem inferior. You gain a +2 trait bonus on Intimidate checks against creatures one or more size categories smaller than yourself. The DC of compulsion spells cast by you against smaller creatures increases by 1.
Wardbreaker 				KEY:Trait ~ Wardbreaker						CATEGORY:Special Ability		TYPE:Trait.RegionalTrait					PREMULT:1,[PREVAREQ:BypassTraitRestriction,1],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.RegionalTrait],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Trait ~ Wardbreaker]					PREREGION:Worldwound					SOURCEPAGE:p.13			DESC:Once per day, you can attempt a melee touch attack against an opponent that you believe has a deflection bonus to AC. If your attack is successful, your foe's def lection bonus to AC is halved (to a minimum of +0) for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier. You can use this ability twice per day at 10th level and three times per day at 20th level.

# Drawbacks
# ==============================

Foul Brand					KEY:Drawback ~ Foul Brand					CATEGORY:Special Ability		TYPE:Drawback								PREMULT:1,[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Drawback],[PREVAREQ:BypassDrawbackRestriction,1],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Drawback ~ Foul Brand]												COST:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.29			DESC:You have the symbol of an evil deity burned into your flesh. If the symbol is on your hand, you take a –1 penalty on Disable Device, Disguise, and Sleight of Hand checks. If the symbol is on your face, you take a –2 penalty on Bluff, Diplomacy, and Disguise checks. This does not count as a holy symbol for the purposes of a divine focus for spellcasting.
Umbral Unmasking			KEY:Drawback ~ Umbral Unmasking				CATEGORY:Special Ability		TYPE:Drawback								PREMULT:1,[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Drawback],[PREVAREQ:BypassDrawbackRestriction,1],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Drawback ~ Umbral Unmasking]											COST:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.29			DESC:You cast no shadow whatsoever, or the shadow you do have is monstrous. Under normal lighted conditions, this is not hard to observe—but uncommon to notice. Creatures that succeed at a DC 15 Wisdom check notice it plainly (an additional Perception check may be required based on environmental conditions). This telltale sign of wickedness cannot be concealed by misdirection, nondetection, or illusions, except those that also affect shadows (such as invisibility).
Warded Against Nature		KEY:Drawback ~ Warded Against Nature		CATEGORY:Special Ability		TYPE:Drawback								PREMULT:1,[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Drawback],[PREVAREQ:BypassDrawbackRestriction,1],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Drawback ~ Warded Against Nature]									COST:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.29			DESC:Animals do not willingly approach within 30 feet of you, unless you or the animal's master succeeds at a DC 20 Handle Animal, Ride, or wild empathy check. Animal companions, familiars, and mounts granted by your class abilities are immune to this effect.
