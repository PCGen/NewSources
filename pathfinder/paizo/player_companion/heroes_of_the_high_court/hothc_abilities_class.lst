Aromatic Extract			KEY:Discovery ~ Aromatic Extract		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AlchemistClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.AlchemistDiscovery																							DESC:The alchemist creates an inhaled version of an extract that is shared among multiple creatures. He must decide that an extract is an aromatic extract when he makes it. When used, the extract grants its benefit to all creatures within a 10-foot spread of the extract. The aromatic extract is treated as having the minimum caster level required for the original extract. An aromatic extract expends one of the alchemist’s daily extracts as if it were an extract 2 levels higher. This discovery can be applied only to extracts with a range of touch. An alchemist must be at least 10th level and must have the infusion discovery before selecting this discovery.
Nostrum KEY:Discovery ~ Nostrum CATEGORY: Special Ability TYPE: AlchemistClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.AlchemistDiscovery  DESC:  When the alchemist creates an infusion, he can mask a delayed poison within the mixture. A nostrum can contain only an ingested poison, and the save DC of the poison is reduced by 2. The poison takes effect a number of hours after being imbibed equal to the alchemist’s Intelligence bonus (minimum 0) decided by the alchemist at the creation of the nostrum. The poison within a nostrum can be detected as normal by spells such as detect poison and similar abilities. Until the nostrum is consumed or destroyed, it continues to occupy one of the alchemist’s daily extract slots. An alchemist must have the infusion discovery before selecting this discovery.
Remote Bomb		KEY:Discovery ~ Remote Bomb		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AlchemistClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.AlchemistDiscovery						DESC:The alchemist can spend two uses of his daily bombs to create a special bomb that is manually detonated. When the bomb is created, the alchemist also creates a catalyst distillate, which requires no extra time or cost. A remote bomb is inert unless triggered by this distillate. The bomb is detonated as a standard action when the distillate fumes are exposed to the rest of the bomb. An alchemist must be within 60 feet of the bomb for the distillate to successfully trigger the bomb. A catalyst distillate can detonate a bomb even if the bomb has already been hurled at a target. Triggering the distillate outside of the 60-foot range or after 1 hour has no effect.
