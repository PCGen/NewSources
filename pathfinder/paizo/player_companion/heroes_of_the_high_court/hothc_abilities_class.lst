Aromatic Extract			KEY:Discovery ~ Aromatic Extract		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AlchemistClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.AlchemistDiscovery																							DESC:The alchemist creates an inhaled version of an extract that is shared among multiple creatures. He must decide that an extract is an aromatic extract when he makes it. When used, the extract grants its benefit to all creatures within a 10-foot spread of the extract. The aromatic extract is treated as having the minimum caster level required for the original extract. An aromatic extract expends one of the alchemist’s daily extracts as if it were an extract 2 levels higher. This discovery can be applied only to extracts with a range of touch. An alchemist must be at least 10th level and must have the infusion discovery before selecting this discovery.
Nostrum KEY:Discovery ~ Nostrum CATEGORY: Special Ability TYPE: AlchemistClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.AlchemistDiscovery  DESC:  When the alchemist creates an infusion, he can mask a delayed poison within the mixture. A nostrum can contain only an ingested poison, and the save DC of the poison is reduced by 2. The poison takes effect a number of hours after being imbibed equal to the alchemist’s Intelligence bonus (minimum 0) decided by the alchemist at the creation of the nostrum. The poison within a nostrum can be detected as normal by spells such as detect poison and similar abilities. Until the nostrum is consumed or destroyed, it continues to occupy one of the alchemist’s daily extract slots. An alchemist must have the infusion discovery before selecting this discovery.
Remote Bomb		KEY:Discovery ~ Remote Bomb		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AlchemistClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.AlchemistDiscovery						DESC:The alchemist can spend two uses of his daily bombs to create a special bomb that is manually detonated. When the bomb is created, the alchemist also creates a catalyst distillate, which requires no extra time or cost. A remote bomb is inert unless triggered by this distillate. The bomb is detonated as a standard action when the distillate fumes are exposed to the rest of the bomb. An alchemist must be within 60 feet of the bomb for the distillate to successfully trigger the bomb. A catalyst distillate can detonate a bomb even if the bomb has already been hurled at a target. Triggering the distillate outside of the 60-foot range or after 1 hour has no effect.

Anthem of Pageantry				KEY:Masterpiece ~ Anthem of Pageantry 													CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.Masterpiece														DESC:This lengthy piece gradually increases in power and gravity, conjuring magnificent furnishings and outfits out of thin air.	DESC: This piece, developed from ancient Azlanti musical records about the just rewards of honest striving, consists of a series of complicated crescendos, each culminating in a stirring, lengthy refrain. When you complete the performance, a single room or chamber you occupy appears to be swathed in silks and opulent furnishings you envision. You and up to one ally per bard level within the room who can hear you are clothed in illusory exotic fabrics, furs, and jewels while in the room. If you or an affected ally leave the room before the effect’s duration expires, the illusion ends. A creature can attempt a Will save to disbelieve the illusion. Use: 1 bardic performance round per 10 minutes of the effect's duration. Action: 5 full rounds.	SOURCEPAGE:p.7

Melody of Surrender  KEY:Masterpiece ~ Melody of Surrender  CATEGORY:Special Ability TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.Masterpiece DESC:This lilting tune is soothing and repetitive. When you activate the performance, choose one creature per bard level within close range. Any targeted creature must succeed at a Will save or take a –2 penalty on saving throws against enchantment effects and on Sense Motive checks. This effect lasts for as long as you maintain the performance. Use: 1 bardic performance round per round. Action: 1 round. SOURCEPAGE:p.7

Wise King's Saga KEY:Masterpiece ~ Wise King's Saga CATEGORY:Special Ability TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.Masterpiece DESC:You begin an epic tale of kings and queens in ages past, recounting their lineages and sage deeds. The epic has no fixed form and has substantial room for improvisation; many bards include tales of their own wise ancestors, or the ancestors of noteworthy members of their audience. When you activate the performance, one target creature other than you within close range (25 feet + 5 feet/2 levels) gains the benefit of a commune spell. You must continue the performance for the target to receive answers, as your retelling is magically guided to include relevant responses. If you cease the performance before the target has asked all of its questions, or if you run out of bardic performance rounds, any remaining questions are lost. Use: 10 bardic performance rounds, plus one bardic performance round per question. Action: 10 minutes. SOURCEPAGE: p.7
