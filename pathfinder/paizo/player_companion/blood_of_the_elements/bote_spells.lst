Storm Step						TYPE:Arcane.Divine	CLASSES:Magus,Sorcerer,Wizard,Witch=3					SCHOOL:Conjuration		SUBSCHOOL:Teleportation		DESCRIPTOR:Electricity				COMPS:V, S											CASTTIME:1 standard action		RANGE:Close			TARGETAREA:You							DURATION:Instantaneous						SAVEINFO:Reflex halves					SPELLRES:Yes												SOURCEPAGE:p.13				DESC:You are able to harness the power of the storm to transport yourself a short distance, by taking the form of a furious, sizzling bolt of elemental electricity. You must either have line of sight to your destination or you must specify a direction and distance within range. Creatures and objects in the path of your passage take (CASTERLEVEL/2,5)d8 points of electricity damage. A successful Reflex save halves the damage. If your path intersects with a solid object, you damage the barrier accordingly. If the damage is enough to break through the barrier, you continue beyond the barrier as long as the spell's range permits; otherwise, your movement stops in the square adjacent to the barrier and the effect ends.
