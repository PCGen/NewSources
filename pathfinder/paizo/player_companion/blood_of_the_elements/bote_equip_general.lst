Phlogiston Vial							TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Consumable						COST:1000					SOURCEPAGE:p.23				SPROP:The vial is sealed with a brass cap and attached to a lightweight gold chain. When the chain is wrapped around a divine caster’s holy symbol, the saving throw DC of the next banishment or dismissal spell he casts on an outsider with the fire subtypeis increased by 4, and additionally, the caster gains a +2 alchemical bonus on the caster level check to overcome the creature’s spell resistance against the spell. If the spell is successful, the outsider leaves behind a small pile of magical ashes and the phlogiston vial cannot be used to banish outsiders again until the oil inside is replaced. If the ashes are collected and placed inside the vial, and the vial is used as an additional material component for a planar ally spell, the spell conjures the exact same outsider, provided the creature is a viable target of that spell. The owner of the vial receives a +4 bonus on her Charisma check to negotiate with the creature. The ashes are consumed after an agreement with the creature is made.
