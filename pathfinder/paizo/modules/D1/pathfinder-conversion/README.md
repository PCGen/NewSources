# Crown of the Kobold King - Pathfinder conversion
Brings Paizo's Gamemastery module *D1: Crown of the Kobold King* from 3.5e to Pathfinder.

## Promotional Summary
The crown of the kobold king will be anointed in blood. Five children from the town of Falcon's Hollow have gone missing, dragged off into ruins underneath a cursed dwarven monastery. Soon they will be sacrificed to the crown, all to the glory of the twisted King of the Kobolds. If they are to be saved from this gruesome fate, brave heroes must follow their trail to the monastery and plumb the depths of its trap-laden and monster-infested halls.

## Implementations
