# Hungry are the Dead - Pathfinder Conversion
Brings Paizo's Gamemastery module *D0: Hollow's Last Hope* from 3.5e to Pathfinder.

## Promotional Summary
The logging town of Falcon’s Hollow has been through rough times -- first a kobold tribe abducted the town’s children for an evil ritual, then an unknown force reanimated the defeated kobolds to attack the town. Now a horde of zombies approaches and a mysterious evil gathers power in the north, tainting wildlife and the buried dead, its presence hinting at ancient evils better left undisturbed.
