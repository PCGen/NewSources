# Hollow's Last Hope - Pathfinder Conversion
Brings Paizo's Gamemastery module *D0: Hollow's Last Hope* from 3.5e to Pathfinder.

## Promotional Summary
The town of Falcon's Hollow needs a miracle. The plague has come to the town of Falcon's Hollow, and not even the town's priest can abate its wretched course. With the coughs of the sick and the wails of the dying echoing through town, the local herbalist uncovers a cure, but she needs some brave heroes to retrieve the ingredients. Finding the cure means risking the dangerous Darkmoon Vale, infiltrating a witch's haunted hut, and delving the ruins of an abandoned dwarven monastery.
