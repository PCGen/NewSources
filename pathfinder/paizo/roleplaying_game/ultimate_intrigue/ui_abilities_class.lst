Dual Identity					KEY:Vigilante ~ Dual Identity					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Vigilante Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary											SOURCEPAGE:p.9	DESC:A vigilante hides his true identity, allowing him to move about social circles and nobility without carrying the stigma of his ruthless actions. In effect, the vigilante has two identities: one is a polite member of society while the other is a skilled and cunning warrior. To keep up this charade, the vigilante usually has two names: his true name, used in polite company, and his vigilante name, used to strike fear in the hearts of those who oppose him. Knowledge checks about one do not reveal information about the other, unless the vigilante’s true identity revealed to the world at large. The vigilante can start each day in either of his identities, referred to simply as social or vigilante. Changing from one identity to another takes 1 minute and must be done out of sight from other creatures to preserve the vigilante’s secret. Changing identities is more than just changing outfits and clothing (although that is certainly a part of it); the process often also involves applying make-up, altering his hair, and adjusting other personal effects. Furthermore, the change is as much a state of mind as of body, so items such as a hat of disguise and similar spells and effects that change the user’s appearance do not reduce the time required to change identities. Most social talents require the vigilante to be in his social identity, but a vigilante who uses vigilante talents in his social identity risks exposing his secret. Despite being a single person, a vigilante’s dual nature allows him to have two alignments, one for each of his identities. When in an identity, he is treated as having that identity’s alignment for all spells, magic items, and abilities that rely on alignment. For the purpose of meeting a qualification for a feat, class, or any ability, he is only eligible if both of his alignments meet the requirements. A vigilante’s two alignments cannot be more than one step from each other on a single alignment axis. For example, a vigilante with a lawful neutral social identity could have a vigilante identity that is lawful good, lawful neutral, lawful evil, neutral, neutral good, or neutral evil. If a vigilante is the target of an effect that would change his alignment, it changes both of his alignments to the new alignment. Any attempts to scry or otherwise locate the vigilante work only if the vigilante is currently in the identity the creature is attempting to locate (or if the creature knows that the two identities are the same individual). Otherwise, the spell or effect has no effect, revealing nothing but darkness, as if the target were invalid or did not exist.
Seamless Guise					KEY:Vigilante ~ Seamless Guise				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Vigilante Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DEFINE:SeamlessGuiseBonus|0						SOURCEPAGE:p.10	DESC:A vigilante knows how to behave in a way that appears perfectly proper and normal for his current identity. Should anyone suspect him of being anything other than what he appears to be while either in his social or vigilante identity, he can attempt a Disguise check with a +%1 circumstance bonus to appear as his current identity, and not as his other identity.|SeamlessGuiseBonus		BONUS:VAR|SeamlessGuiseBonus|20
Social Talent					KEY:Vigilante ~ Social Talent					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Vigilante Class Feature.SpecialQuality			DEFINE:SocialTalentCount|0						SOURCEPAGE:p.10	DESC:Starting at 1st level, and every 2 levels thereafter, a vigilante gains a social talent. Unless otherwise noted, a talent can be selected only once. Some talents require the vigilante to meet other prerequisites before they can be chosen, such as having another social talent or attaining a minimum vigilante level. Once a talent has been chosen, it cannot be changed.		BONUS:VAR|SocialTalentCount|(VigilanteLVL+1)/2		BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Vigilante Social Talent|SocialTalentCount

Unless otherwise noted, a talent can be selected only once. Some talents require the vigilante to meet prerequisites before they can be chosen, such as possessing another vigilante talent, possessing a particular specialization, or attaining a minimum level. Once a talent has been selected, it can’t be changed. If the vigilante uses any of these talents while in his social identity, he must succeed at a Disguise check against the Perception checks of all onlookers (without the +%1 circumstance bonus from seamless guise) or the onlookers will realize that he is more than his social identity appears to be and perhaps discover the social and vigilante identities are one and the same.|SeamlessGuiseBonus	BONUS:VAR|VigilanteTalentCount|VigilanteLVL/2		BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Vigilante Talent|VigilanteTalentCount	BONUS:VAR|VigilanteTalentDC|10+VigilanteLVL/2+CHA

Startling Appearance				KEY:Vigilante ~ Startling Appearance			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Vigilante Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary											SOURCEPAGE:p.17	DESC:A vigilante learns to use the element of surprise to his advantage, startling foes that are unaware of his presence. Whenever a vigilante with this ability attempts an attack against a foe that is completely unaware of the vigilante’s presence (usually due to Stealth or invisibility), the foe is treated as flat-footed for the rest of the vigilante’s turn (uncanny dodge or a similar ability prevents this effect unless the vigilante is at least 4 levels higher than the foe with uncanny dodge). The foe also takes a –4 penalty on attacks made against the vigilante until the start of the vigilante’s next turn.
Frightening Appearance				KEY:Vigilante ~ Frightening Appearance			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Vigilante Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary											SOURCEPAGE:p.17	DESC:Whenever a vigilante with this ability makes an attack against a foe that is unaware of the vigilante’s presence, the vigilante can, as a free action, attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize the target of his attack and any enemies within 10 feet who can see the attack. This check is attempted before the attack roll against the foe is made and resolved. The vigilante rolls only one Intimidate check and applies the result to all the targets. If the check succeeds against the target of the vigilante’s attack, that foe is also frightened for 1 round, in addition to being shaken as normal, unless the foe succeeds at a Will save (DC %1). Once a creature has been the target of this ability (either as the target of the attack or as a nearby creature, regardless of whether or not it was successful), it is immune to that vigilante’s frightening appearance for 24 hours. This effect is in addition to the bonuses gained from the startling appearance ability. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.|10+VigilanteLVL/2+CHA
Stunning Appearance				KEY:Vigilante ~ Stunning Appearance				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Vigilante Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary											SOURCEPAGE:p.17	DESC:A vigilante can leave his foes unable to respond when he appears. Whenever a vigilante with this ability makes a successful attack against a foe that is unaware of the vigilante’s presence, the foe must make a successful Will save (DC %1) or be stunned until the end of the vigilante’s next turn. If the creature has more than %2 HD, it receives a +4 circumstance bonus on this save. This ability is in addition to the effects of startling appearance and frightening appearance. Once a creature has been the target of this ability (regardless of whether or not the saving throw is successful), it is immune to that vigilante’s stunning appearance for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.|10+VigilanteLVL/2+CHA|VigilanteLVL
Vengeance Strike					KEY:Vigilante ~ Vengeance Strike				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Vigilante Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary											SOURCEPAGE:p.17	DESC:A vigilante can study a target to strike more viciously. He can spend up to 5 standard actions, which all must be in consecutive rounds. On the following round, he can make a vengeance strike against the studied creature. The target must remain unaware of the vigilante’s presence (or not see him as a threat) until the attack. For each round spent studying the target, the vigilante grants himself one of the following benefits on his vengeance strike: gain a +4 circumstance bonus on the attack roll, deal an additional 3d6 points of precision damage if he hits, or treat the attack roll as if it were 2 higher for the purposes of determining whether the attack hit or threatens a critical hit (to maximum effective roll of 20). Each round of study can be spent in a different way or the same way (they stack with each other), but each round of study must be allocated before the attack roll is made. 	DESC:He automatically confirms any critical hits threatened by his vengeance strike.|PREVAREQ:VigilanteIsAvenger,1	DESC:If the vigilante would normally be able to add a special effect from a vigilante talent with an asterisk (*) to this attack, he can instead add two special effects to his vengeance strike.|PREVAREQ:VigilanteIsAvenger,0

Avenger						KEY:Vigilante Specialization ~ Avenger			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:VigilanteSpecialization.SpecialQuality													SOURCEPAGE:p.13	DESC:An avenger has a base attack bonus equal to his vigilante level.

Stalker						KEY:Vigilante Specialization ~ Stalker			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:VigilanteSpecialization.SpecialQuality			DEFINE:HiddenStrikeDiceCount|0					SOURCEPAGE:p.13	DESC:A stalker gains an ability called hidden strike, which allows him to deal an extra %1d8 points of precision damage on melee attacks (or ranged attacks from within 30 feet) against foes who are unaware of his presence, who consider him an ally, or who are made flat-footed by startling appearance. A stalker vigilante can also deal hidden strike damage to a target that he is flanking or that is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, but in these cases, the damage is reduced to %1d4. A stalker can deal hidden strike damage against targets with concealment (but not total concealment). A stalker can apply only one talent marked with an asterisk (*) to a given hidden strike, and only when that hidden strike is dealt against a foe that is unaware of the stalker vigilante’s presence (or who considers him an ally), unless otherwise noted.|HiddenStrikeDiceCount		BONUS:VAR|HiddenStrikeDiceCount|(VigilanteLVL+1)/2		ASPECT:Ability Benefit|%1d8 (or %1d4)|HiddenStrikeDiceCount

###Block: Social Talents
Any Guise						KEY:Social Talent ~ Any Guise					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Social Talent.SpecialQuality.Supernatural		PRECLASS:1,Vigilante=17		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Social Talent ~ Everyman								SOURCEPAGE:p.10	DESC:A vigilante can use his everyman social talent to disguise himself as any specific person, even a king or high priest. Furthermore, if the actual individual wouldn’t normally be able to be found via magic (such as by being dead or protected from divinations designed to locate the individual), such divinations always find the vigilante instead.
Case the Joint					KEY:Social Talent ~ Case The Joint				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Social Talent.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																									SOURCEPAGE:p.10	DESC:The vigilante can use his social identity to learn important facts about a location before returning later in his vigilante identity. If he spends at least 1 hour in a location while in his social identity, he can attempt a DC 20 Knowledge (engineering) check. If he succeeds, he gains the ability to later reroll any one failed skill check involving the location’s layout (such as a Stealth check to sneak into the location, a Disable Device check to disable an alarm, or a Sleight of Hand check to snatch an object from a pedestal). For every 10 by which the check exceeds 20, the vigilante gains an additional reroll. If the vigilante fails to return to the location within 1 week, the situation changes too much and he cannot use the rerolls. A vigilante can’t case the same joint more than once a week.
Celebrity Discount				KEY:Social Talent ~ Celebrity Discount			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Social Talent.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		PRECLASS:1,Vigilante=3		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Social Talent ~ Renown								SOURCEPAGE:p.10	DESC:The vigilante’s social identity is popular enough to receive discounts in his area of renown. Whenever he buys an item in his area of renown that costs 500 gp or less, he can buy it at 90%% of the market price, rather than the full price.|CelebrityDiscountValue	DEFINE:CelebrityDiscountValue|0	BONUS:VAR|CelebrityDiscountValue|500	BONUS:VAR|CelebrityDiscountValue|1500|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Social Talent ~ Great Renown	BONUS:VAR|CelebrityDiscountValue|6000|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Social Talent ~ Incredible Renown

While within his area of renown, he can always receive common meals or lodging (worth up to %1 gp per meal or night) for free, and can avoid paying taxes or bribes of %1 gp or less. If he wants a particular nonmagical item worth %2 gp or less, he can spend 1d10 minutes interacting with people in his area of renown to receive the item from a fan (if he ever sells such a gift from a fan, he loses this social talent permanently).|CelebrityPerksMealsBribes|CelebrityPerksGifts	DEFINE:CelebrityPerksMealsBribes|0	DEFINE:CelebrityPerksGifts|0	BONUS:VAR|CelebrityPerksMealsBribes|1	BONUS:VAR|CelebrityPerksGifts|1	BONUS:VAR|CelebrityPerksMealsBribes|9|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Social Talent ~ Great Renown	BONUS:VAR|CelebrityPerksGifts|4|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Social Talent ~ Great Renown	BONUS:VAR|CelebrityPerksMealsBribes|90|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Social Talent ~ Incredible Renown	BONUS:VAR|CelebrityPerksGifts|20|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Social Talent ~ Incredible Renown
Double Time						KEY:Social Talent ~ Double Time				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Social Talent.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																									SOURCEPAGE:p.11	DESC:The vigilante’s social identity is that of a skilled and respected artisan or professional, rather than a merchant or noble. In order to complete his day’s work while still continuing his vigilante activities, he has learned to work faster than normal, hiding his progress so it seems like he is working full shifts at his day job rather than spending some of that time on other pursuits. The vigilante needs to spend only 6 hours each day for mundane uses of the Craft or Profession skill, rather than 8 hours. If he has the social grace social talent, he needs to spend only 4 hours for any skill he’s chosen with social grace. A vigilante must have a social identity appropriate to the chosen skill to select this talent.
Everyman						KEY:Social Talent ~ Everyman					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Social Talent.SpecialQuality.Supernatural		PRECLASS:1,Vigilante=11		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Social Talent ~ Many Guises								SOURCEPAGE:p.11	DESC:The vigilante can take on the appearance of a specific individual whenever he assumes a mundane guise using his many guises social talent. The individual must be a farmer, laborer, or peasant. While disguised as this individual, the vigilante receives a +20 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks to appear as that individual. Any spell or ability designed to locate the individual has a 50%% chance of finding the vigilante instead of the actual individual, and divination spells and abilities used on the vigilante give results as if he were the actual individual. Although this doesn’t grant the vigilante any special knowledge of the individual, the vigilante’s training grants him a +10 circumstance bonus on Bluff checks to properly play the part of the individual.
Feign Innocence					KEY:Social Talent ~ Feign Innocence				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Social Talent.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		PRECLASS:1,Vigilante=5		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Social Talent ~ Renown								SOURCEPAGE:p.11	DESC:The vigilante’s social identity seems so innocent that it is hard to believe he was involved in wrongdoing. Within his area of renown, this provides a nonmagical effect identical to the innocence spell (Advanced Player's Guide p. 229.)
Gossip Collector					KEY:Social Talent ~ Gossip Collector			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Social Talent.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																									SOURCEPAGE:p.11	DESC:The vigilante sits at the center of a web of gossip, granting him access to the latest scuttlebutt with baffling speed. Whenever the vigilante is presented with a topic about which he would normally need to spend 1d4 hours to gather information, he must spend only 1d2 hours instead. If he has the renown social talent and gathers the information in his area of renown, he must instead spend only 1d4 × 10 minutes, and if he beats the DC to gather a piece of information by 20 or more, he knows that piece of information without spending any time at all; he has simply already heard that gossip. This ability doesn’t allow him to gather information that isn’t available in the locale he is canvassing, even if that locale is his area of renown.
Great Renown					KEY:Social Talent ~ Great Renown				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Social Talent.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		PRECLASS:1,Vigilante=7		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Social Talent ~ Renown								SOURCEPAGE:p.11	DESC:The vigilante is known on a broader scale. He can gain renown in a single community of up to 5,000 individuals (a large town) or up to two communities of no more than 2,000 individuals each (two small towns).

Goods he crafts with a Craft skill he chose with social grace are worth 1/3 more gp than normal due to his celebrity, without increasing the cost to create. Whenever he uses a Profession skill he chose with social grace to make money, he makes twice as much money.
Incredible Renown					KEY:Social Talent ~ Incredible Renown			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Social Talent.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		PRECLASS:1,Vigilante=11		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Social Talent ~ Great Renown							SOURCEPAGE:p.11	DESC:The vigilante is incredibly famous in both identities.

Loyal Aid						KEY:Social Talent ~ Loyal Aid					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Social Talent.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		PRECLASS:1,Vigilante=3		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Social Talent ~ Renown								SOURCEPAGE:p.11	DESC:The vigilante gains the service of a number of loyal allies who can help him gather information, cover for his two identities, or perform minor tasks. Inside his area of renown, a vigilante with this talent gains a +%1 bonus on Diplomacy checks to gather information. In addition, if the vigilante wants, he can task his friends to help cover for him by spreading false tales of his location and activities to others. This has the effect of increasing the DC of Diplomacy checks to gather information about the vigilante and Survival checks to track him by %2. This lasts for 1 day, and can be used only once per week. Finally, once per day, the vigilante can ask his allies to perform a minor task for him. This usually involves delivering a message, purchasing a piece of mundane gear worth 100 gp or less (which the vigilante must pay for), or retrieving an object owned by the vigilante (that would be easily accessible by the ally). This task might take other forms as well, subject to GM discretion, but can never involve combat or danger.|VigilanteLVL/2|VigilanteLVL		BONUS:SITUATION|Diplomacy=Gather Information|VigilanteLVL/2
Many Guises						KEY:Social Talent ~ Many Guises				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Social Talent.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		PRECLASS:1,Vigilante=5																				SOURCEPAGE:p.12	DESC:The vigilante can take on any number of mundane guises. Whenever he changes his identity, he has a third option (instead of social or vigilante): he can become mundane. The mundane identity is not a specific individual. Each one is created at the moment it is assumed, and quickly forgotten as soon as it is removed. While in a mundane identity, the vigilante does not gain the benefit of either his social or vigilante identity, but instead appears as a member of his race, usually a common laborer, farmer, or peasant of any gender. His alignment is treated as neutral when he is in his mundane identity. While in this identity, he receives a +20 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks to appear like an ordinary member of his race. Spells and abilities that are looking for the vigilante in either of his other identities fail while he is in his mundane identity. He must build the appearance for this identity using whatever clothing and tools he has at his disposal. While he can use magic (such as a hat of disguise), his mundane identity can never be anything other than an ordinary member of a society or large group (subject to GM discretion).
Mockingbird						KEY:Social Talent ~ Mockingbird				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Social Talent.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		PRECLASS:1,Vigilante=5																				SOURCEPAGE:p.12	DESC:The vigilante can mimic almost any sort of voice, or even animal calls and sound effects, and he can throw his voice at a distance. This functions similarly to a combination of the ghost sound, ventriloquism, and vocal alteration spells.
Quick Change					KEY:Social Talent ~ Quick Change				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Social Talent.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		PRECLASS:1,Vigilante=7																				SOURCEPAGE:p.12	DESC:The vigilante learns to shift between his identities with ease. Instead of needing 1 minute to change his identity, he can now do so as a full-round action. If, after a quick change, he encounters any creature familiar with both of his identities, he must attempt a Disguise check to avoid the creature seeing through his hastily donned disguise and realizing that the identities are, in fact, the same person. The vigilante can spend 1 additional round adjusting and perfecting his appearance and persona to negate the need for this check.
Renown						KEY:Social Talent ~ Renown					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Social Talent.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																									SOURCEPAGE:p.12	DESC:The vigilante becomes known for deeds and abilities regardless of his current identity. This renown grants him favorable treatment in civilized company and lends him an air of menace while facing down his enemies. While he is in his social identity, a vigilante can spend 1 week gaining renown among the locals of any community of no more than about 200 individuals (a village). This could be the entire community or a smaller neighborhood in a larger settlement. He must spend at least 4 hours each day socializing and making contacts. After spending 1 week doing this, whenever he is in his social identity, all NPCs in the community have a starting attitude toward him that is one category better, as long as each person’s initial attitude would have at least been indifferent. While he gains renown in an area using his social identity, he also spreads rumors and tales about his vigilante identity. Once he has gained renown in a community, he gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Intimidate checks whenever he is in his vigilante identity. This bonus applies only while he is near the community in which he has gained renown; he must be within %1 miles. A vigilante can hold renown in a limited number of communities (normally one, with other social talents allowing two). If he gains renown in a new community, he must decide which one of his previous communities to lose. These effects are subject to GM approval. For example, the GM might rule that an NPC or monster has not heard any tales about the vigilante. Or, a foe may have a starting attitude toward him that’s one category worse, rather than one category better.|VigilanteLVL		BONUS:SITUATION|Intimidate=In Vigilante Identity|4|TYPE=Circumstance.STACK
Safe House						KEY:Social Talent ~ Safe House				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Social Talent.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																									SOURCEPAGE:p.12	DESC:The vigilante can establish a safe house in his area of renown, and he can change it every time he changes his area of renown. If he doesn’t have the renown talent, he can still select this talent and place the safe house in a single location to which he has access, but he can never move the safe house from its initial location until he gains the renown talent. This safe house must be an area no larger in volume than a cube that is %1 feet per side. The safe house can be arranged any way he likes and it can be part of a larger building, like a secret room or an underground cave. Objects within this safe house can’t be located by any effect that is less powerful than a discern location spell.|VigilanteLVL*10	DESC: This protection from being located also applies to creatures in the safe house.|PRECLASS:1,Vigilante=7	DESC: The entire area is protected from scrying effects (though not mundane snooping) like a mage’s private sanctum.|PRECLASS:1,Vigilante=13

As long as what he says is true from the point of view of his current identity, it detects as true to effects such as discern lies, and he can say it in effects such as zone of truth that force him to speak the truth.
Triumphant Return					KEY:Social Talent ~ Triumphant Return			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Social Talent.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		PRECLASS:1,Vigilante=3		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Social Talent ~ Renown								SOURCEPAGE:p.13	DESC:The vigilante’s tales are never truly forgotten. This makes it easier to establish his renown in a place he has established it before. In any settlement where the vigilante previously gained renown, it takes only 3 days, rather than 1 week, to gain renown again.

###Block: Vigilante Talents 
Another Day						KEY:Vigilante Talent ~ Another Day				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Vigilante Talent.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.Supernatural													SOURCEPAGE:p.13	DESC:When the vigilante is dropped unconscious due to hit point damage, he automatically stabilizes, but he can also appear to be dead, unless an examining creature succeeds at a Heal check (DC %1) or, if using magic such as deathwatch, a caster level check with the same DC (the ability to affect spells is supernatural; the rest of the ability is extraordinary). The vigilante counts as having received aid and automatically succeeds at the Constitution check to become conscious after 1 hour (unless he has actually died in the meantime).|20+VigilanteLVL

This includes senses such as blindsense, blindsight, lifesense, scent, or tremorsense. For each such ability that the creature possesses, if the vigilante is not bypassing the sense in another way—such as the negate aroma spell for scent or flying for tremorsense—the creature gains a stacking +20 circumstance bonus on all Perception checks to notice the vigilante, rather than automatically noticing the vigilante.

###Block: Archetypes
# METAMORPH (ARCHETYPE)
# Metamorphs eschew traditional alchemy, focusing on
# internal chemistry and the transfiguration of living forms.
# Class Skills: A metamorph adds Disguise to her list of
# class skills.
# This alters the alchemist’s class skills.
# Shapechanger (Su): At 1st level, a metamorph gains
# the ability to transform herself into another form. This
# ability functions like alter self, except as noted here. The
# effect lasts for 1 hour per metamorph’s alchemist level, or
# until she changes back. Changing form (to another form
# or back) is a standard action that doesn’t provoke attacks of
# opportunity. The metamorph is fatigued for 1 round each
# time she changes shape.
# A metamorph can use this ability once per day at 1st
# level, and an additional time per day at 4th level, and every
# 2 alchemist levels thereafter, for a total of nine times at
# 18th level. At 20th level, a metamorph can use shapechanger
# as a free action once per round, either before or after all her
# other actions, with no daily limit.
# This ability can also function as monstrous physique IUM at
# 5th level, as monstrous physique IIUM at 9th level, as monstrous
# physique IIIUM at 11th level, as monstrous physique IVUM or giant
# form I at 13th level, and as giant form II at 15th level.
# This ability replaces alchemy (which also includes bombs,
# extracts, and mutagen) and Throw Anything.
# Mutagen (Ex): At 1st level, a metamorph gains mutagen
# as a normal alchemist. She can take mutagen and
# cognatogen discoveries despite not possessing the alchemy
# class feature that normally grants mutagen.
# Adaptive Physiology (Ex): At 3rd level, a metamorph gains
# a 25% chance to negate critical hits and precision damage,
# similar to the preserve organs discovery. This chance
# increases to 50% at 6th level, and to 75% at 18th level.
# This ability replaces swift alchemy, swift poisoning, and
# instant alchemy.
