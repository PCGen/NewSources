TO DO LIST
Asavir Prestige Class - Equine Bond needs work to interact correctly with other classes that may grant companions, especially cavalier
Curator Occultist Archetype - Unsure how to implement Extensive Collection, Adaptable Powers. Not entirely sure how exactly this differs from Occultist! VERY confusing.
Golden Legionnaire Prestige Class - May eventually want to set up a chooser system for Defy Danger options similar to ranger favored choosers;
Blossoming Light Cleric Archetype - Need to kill domain spells somehow!?
Rivethun Emissary - Need to set up a system to restrict spirit animal evolution choices.
