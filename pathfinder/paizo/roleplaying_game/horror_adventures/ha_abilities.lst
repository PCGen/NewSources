Accursed						KEY:Corruption ~ Accursed						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CorruptionType														DEFINE:AccursedCorruptionResistance|0		SOURCEPAGE:p.16		DESC:A foul curse has a deep hold on your body and soul. Your resentment toward the one who cursed you has taken on a life of its own. You notice slights against you by everyone around you, and can gain solace only by punishing them. The progression is tied to spiteful actions you take that have lasting consequences. When you inflict a permanent or long-lasting curse, such as bestow curse, or engage in brutal retaliation (what constitutes brutal retaliation is up to the GM, but usually includes disproportionate acts of violence against living creatures), you must attempt a Will saving throw (DC %1). You must also attempt a saving throw after any month in which you have failed to perform a number of spiteful retaliations equal to or greater than your manifestation level. If you fail any of these saving throws, you must use the most severe punishment at your disposal against the next creature that wrongs you, even in a minor way. If you fail the save but your allies or others prevent you from exacting your retribution for three consecutive slights, you shake off this urge. You avoid having to exact retribution for the time being, and your corruption doesn’t progress. However, the DC of the Will save against your corruption progressing increases by 2. These increases stack each time you shake off this urge, and they last until your corruption reaches the next corruption stage.|15+AccursedManifestationLevel		DESC:You gain a +%1 circumstance bonus on saving throws related to the corruption progressing.|AccursedCorruptionResistance|PREVARGTEQ:AccursedCorruptionResistance,1		ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Accursed Corruption Counter		BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Accursed Manifestation Choice|min(AccursedManifestationLevel,AccursedManifestationCount)

Ghoul							KEY:Corruption ~ Ghoul							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CorruptionType														DEFINE:GhoulCorruptionResistance|0			SOURCEPAGE:p.20		DESC:A hunger for the flesh of the living grows more every day, until every sentient creature seems no more than a meal. Each week, you need to consume one portion of flesh from a sentient creature. A creature one size category smaller than you counts as one portion, a creature of your size category counts as four portions, and a creature one size larger counts as 16 portions. The extra meat from Huge or larger creatures spoils quickly enough that it can’t all be consumed within a week. After a week, if you haven’t consumed enough flesh, you must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC %1) each day until you’ve eaten enough. If you fail the save, the next time you rest your corruption takes over and you unconsciously hunt and feed, devouring a living sentient creature completely. In this state, you can’t differentiate between creatures and might consume an innocent; if you do so, your corruption progresses to the next stage. If circumstances make it impossible to feed (such as if you are tied down or in a locale with nothing to feed upon), you start to starve as if you had not eaten in 3 days (Core Rulebook 445), and you continue to hunger for flesh and struggle to escape and feed until you have received five times the amount of flesh from sentient creatures you normally require. If your allies are able to restrain and feed you flesh from sentient creatures, your corruption doesn’t progress. However, the DC of the Will save against your corruption progressing increases by 2. These increases stack each time this occurs, and they last until your corruption reaches the next corruption stage. In addition to starvation, close brushes with death also increase your craving for flesh. Whenever you are dropped below 0 hit points, you must attempt a single saving throw as if you hadn’t eaten enough flesh that week.|15+GhoulManifestationLevel		DESC:You gain a +%1 circumstance bonus on saving throws related to the corruption progressing.|GhoulCorruptionResistance|PREVARGTEQ:GhoulCorruptionResistance,1		ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Ghoul Corruption Counter		BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Ghoul Manifestation Choice|min(GhoulManifestationLevel,GhoulManifestationCount)
