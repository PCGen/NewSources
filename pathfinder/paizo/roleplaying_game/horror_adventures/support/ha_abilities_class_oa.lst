He can use this lifeblood any time within the next 24 hours to create an extract of a spell level he can cast that is no higher than 1/2 the creature’s CR, without spending a daily extract slot. He can use this ability once for each spell level each day (for example, a 13th-level blood alchemist can use lifeblood to gain additional 1st-, 2nd-, 3rd-, 4th-, and 5th-level extracts).

The chosen effect can target or affect only something contained within the circle, or the surface on which the blood alchemist drew the circle. To learn one of these effects, he must write it into his formula book, with the same cost as usual for a formula (he can also use his free formula from leveling up to learn the chosen effect instead of a normal formula). &nl; The blood alchemist can choose from the following spells for this ability: 1st—expeditious excavation (APG), fabricate bullets (UC), jury-rig (U), magic weapon, reinforce armaments (UC); 2nd—knock, make whole, masterwork transformation (UM), silk to steel (UM), soften earth and stone, warp wood; 3rd—keen edge, magic vestment, greater magic weapon, obsidian flow (UC), spike stones, stone shape; 4th—fabricate, passwall, transmute mud to rock, transmute rock to mud; 5th—flesh to stone, move earth, stone to flesh, tar pool (UC), transmute metal to wood; 6th—polymorph any object, transmute blood to acid (UM). &nl;	DESC:The blood alchemist can also create a magic circle, as per the magic circles occultist class ability (Occult Adventures p49), though it costs 1 point from his blood pool instead of 1 point of mental focus. &nl;|PRECLASS:1,Alchemist=8	DESC:He can also create a binding circle, as per the occultist class ability of the same name (Occult Adventures p49), though it costs 2 points from his blood pool instead of 2 points of mental focus. &nl;|PRECLASS:1,Alchemist=12	DESC:The blood alchemist can draw magic circles and binding circles more quickly but with a shorter duration, as per the occultist fast circles ability (Occult Adventures p49).|PRECLASS:1,Alchemist=16		BONUS:VAR|BloodAlchemistBloodPool|AlchemistLVL+INT	ASPECT:CheckCount|%1|BloodAlchemistBloodPool	ASPECT:CheckType|Uses per Day	ASPECT:Ability Benefit|(%1/day)|BloodAlchemistBloodPool
