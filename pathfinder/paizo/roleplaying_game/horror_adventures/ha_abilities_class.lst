Mad Genius				KEY:Mad Scientist ~ Mad Genius			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Alchemist Class Feature.MadScientistClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																						SOURCEPAGE:p.45	DESC:A mad scientist can deal	DESC:1d3 points of Wisdom|!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Internal,Rules ~ Use Sanity	DESC:1d6 points of sanity|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Internal,Rules ~ Use Sanity	DESC:damage to herself to create a genius extract as one of her daily 1st-, 2nd-, 3rd-, 4th-, or 5th-level extracts. This otherwise takes the same amount of time and effort as creating a normal extract of its level, but instead of her choosing a formula she knows for it to grant, a genius extract has an unpredictable result. When the alchemist (or an ally, if she has the infusion discovery) drinks the extract, it produces a random effect from the list of alchemist formulae on page 32 of the Advanced Player's Guide of 1 spell level higher than the extract's spell level. For instance, if she creates a genius extract using a 2nd-level extract, it would produce the effect of a random 3rd-level alchemist formula. There is no way to predict which effect a genius extract will produce before drinking it. A genius extract's minimum caster level is equal to the minimum caster level of the extract used, not the effect produced. So, for instance, a genius extract that produced a fox's cunning effect would have a minimum caster level of 1 (for the 1st-level extract used) rather than 4 (for the 2nd-level effect). There are 29 potential 2nd-level extracts, 23 potential 3rd-level extracts, 18 potential 4th-level extracts, 15 potential 5th-level extracts, and 15 potential 6th-level extracts. This ability alters alchemy.

This ability alters the alchemist's mutagen.

Only the enemy, not the barbarian's ally, needs to be within the barbarian's melee reach in order for the barbarian to make this attack of opportunity. Once the barbarian makes an attack of opportunity against a creature with this ability, she can't use this ability to make an attack of opportunity against the same creature for 24 hours.

She becomes dying or dead at the end of her next turn as normal for her current hit point total. This ability has no effect if the barbarian dies from a cause other than hit point damage, such as from a death effect or if her Constitution damage exceeds her Constitution score.

Fight Response			KEY:Rage Power ~ Fight Response			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.BarbarianClassFeatures.RagePower.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																						SOURCEPAGE:p.46	DESC:When a barbarian with this rage power attempts a saving throw against a fear effect, she can enter a rage as an immediate action (as long as she would normally be able to enter rage). This consumes 3 rounds of the barbarian's daily allotment of rage rounds, but the barbarian can maintain the rage each round on her turn normally. Any benefits from the barbarian's rage apply immediately, so she gains her bonus on Will saves against the effect that required the initial saving throw. Unlike most rage powers, this rage power's effects are useful only when the barbarian is not raging, so a skald can't grant this rage power to allies with raging song.

Unhinged Mind			KEY:Elder Mythos Cultist ~ Unhinged Mind		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Cleric Class Feature.ElderMythosCultistClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																					SOURCEPAGE:p.48	DESC:Bartering sanity for unspeakable knowledge, an Elder Mythos cultist props up his crumbling sanity with a darkly enigmatic personality. An Elder Mythos cultist uses Charisma instead of Wisdom as his key spellcasting ability score (to determine his spell DCs, bonus spells per day, bonus on concentration checks, and so on), to determine the effects and number of uses of his domain powers, and to modify his Will saving throws. However, because of the fragile state of his mind, the Elder Mythos cultist takes a –2 penalty on Will saves to resist mind-affecting effects. An Elder Mythos cultist automatically fails any save to resist the effects of confusion, insanity, and nightmare, and other similar effects so long as the effect's caster level is higher than his character level.

Channel the Void			KEY:Elder Mythos Cultist ~ Channel the Void	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Cleric Class Feature.ElderMythosCultistClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Supernatural.ChannelEnergy.Channel Energy.Channel Energy Negative.Channel Negative Energy									SOURCEPAGE:p.48	DESC:When an Elder Mythos cultist channels energy, he taps into the unthinkable void between the stars. This is similar to channeling negative energy, but instead of healing undead, this blast of energy deals %1d%2 points of positive energy damage, while it harms and devours living beings, corporeal non-skeletal undead, and constructs crafted from flesh (such as flesh golems). This is not negative energy damage; instead, the damage manifests in the form of wounds from supernatural deterioration and rot. A creature that would take damage from this energy can attempt a Fortitude save (DC %3) to halve the damage, rather than a Will save. You can use this ability %4 times per day.|ElderMythosCultistChannelEnergyDice|ElderMythosCultistChannelEnergyDieSize|ElderMythosCultistChannelEnergyDC|ClericChannelEnergyTimes	DESC:A creature that both fails the Fortitude save and would be killed or destroyed by this effect is entirely disintegrated, leaving behind only a trace of fine dust. A disintegrated creature's equipment is unaffected.|PRECLASS:1,Cleric=8	DESC:This ability still counts as channel energy, but it counts as neither positive nor negative energy specifically (for example, the Elder Mythos cultist couldn't take the Turn Undead or Command Undead feat). For the purposes of feats that require channel energy but refer to what happens if the character channels positive or negative energy, this ability alters the listed effect for negative energy. For instance, an Elder Mythos cultist could use Channel Smite to damage living or fleshy creatures with his melee attack. This ability alters channel energy.

Maddening Gaze			KEY:Elder Mythos Cultist ~ Maddening Gaze		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Cleric Class Feature.ElderMythosCultistClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Supernatural																					SOURCEPAGE:p.48	DESC:As a standard action, an Elder Mythos cultist can focus his gaze on a single living creature within 30 feet and inundate the creature's mind with visions of alien horror. The target takes 2 points of Wisdom damage and becomes confused and sickened for 1d4 rounds. A successful Will save (DC %1) negates the Wisdom damage and the confusion effect, though the target is sickened for 1 round. This gaze attack is a mind-affecting effect.

Only greater restoration, heal, limited wish, miracle,or wish can remove the confused and sickened conditions.

Part the Veil			KEY:Domain Power ~ Part the Veil			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.DomainPower										DESC:You can lace spells you cast with the raw madness that waits in the outer darkness. Activating this ability is a swift action that you must use as you cast a spell that targets a single creature and that allows a Will saving throw to negate or reduce the spell's primary effect. If the target fails to resist the spell, the target is also confused for a number of rounds equal to the spell's level as visions of the void cause temporary insanity. The victim can attempt a new saving throw each round to end the effect - these additional saving throws apply only to the additional confusion effect and not to the original spell effect. This is a mind-affecting effect.

A summoned creature that gains the advanced creature simple template in this manner looks unusually deformed or hideous.

This ability replaces the Guarded Mind ability of the Void domain.
