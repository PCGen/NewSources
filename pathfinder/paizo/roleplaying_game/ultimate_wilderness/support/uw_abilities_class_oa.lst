Hypnotic Aroma							KEY:Aromaphile ~ Hypnotic Aroma			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Mesmerist Class Features.AromaphileClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural				DEFINE:AromaphileHypnoticAroma|0	SOURCEPAGE:p.18		DESC:As a swift action, an aromaphile can use unique aspects of ghoran biology to release intoxicating aromas in a 10-foot-radius burst centered on him. All creatures within this area, as well as creatures with scent within 30 feet, take a –%1 penalty on Will saving throws. The aroma hovers around the aromaphile, moving with him, and lasts for 1 minute. The hypnotic aroma must be inhaled to be effective, and creatures that choose to hold their breath, do not breathe, or are immune to inhaled poisons are immune to its effect.|AromaphileHypnoticAroma		BONUS:VAR|AromaphileHypnoticAroma|2	BONUS:VAR|AromaphileHypnoticAroma|1|PRECLASS:1,Mesmerist=8
Debilitating Aroma						KEY:Aromaphile ~ Debilitating Aroma			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Mesmerist Class Features.AromaphileClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural				DEFINE:DebilitatingAromasKnown|0	SOURCEPAGE:p.18		DESC:An aromaphile can imbue his hypnotic aroma with other effects. These effects are the same as those listed within the bold stare mesmerist class feature, but they affect creatures affected by his hypnotic aroma for as long as they are affected by that ability. The aromaphile chooses one option each time he gains a new debilitating aroma improvement, and the choice can’t be changed later. The aromaphile can’t choose the same debilitating aroma more than once unless otherwise noted.

Aromatic Manipulation						KEY:Aromaphile ~ Aromatic Manipulation		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Mesmerist Class Features.AromaphileClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural										SOURCEPAGE:p.18		DESC:The aromaphile can touch a creature affected by his hypnotic aroma to alter its mental state. This functions as the touch treatment class feature, except the aromaphile cannot remove the confused, cowering, or stunned conditions, and he cannot break enchantments using this ability. Instead, he adds fatigued	DESC:and exhausted|PREVARGTEQ:MesmeristLVL,10	DESC:to his list of removable conditions. An aromaphile can also use this ability to inflict hampering conditions on a target by touching it. He can cause his target to become fascinated by his aroma.	DESC:He can deaden the target’s emotions (as per calm emotions).|PREVARGTEQ:MesmeristLVL,6	DESC:He can cause the target to become stunned.|PREVARGTEQ:MesmeristLVL,10	DESC:He can cause the target to fall asleep (as per deep slumber, except the Hit Die limit is %1).|MesmeristLVL+2|PREVARGTEQ:MesmeristLVL,14	DESC:The target can attempt a Will save to negate these effects (DC %1). On a failed save, the target gains the chosen condition for %2 rounds. Each round that the target is affected, it can attempt a new Will save at the same DC to end the effect early. If the target succeeds at such a save, its turn immediately ends. This alters touch treatment.|10+MesmeristLVL/2+CHA|MesmeristLVL
