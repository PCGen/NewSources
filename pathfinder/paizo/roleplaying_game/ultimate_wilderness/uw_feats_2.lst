Animals can attempt a Will save (DC = 10 + half your class level + your Charisma modifier) to negate the effect. Animals that fail their saves fall under your control, obeying your commands to the best of their ability as if under the effects of a charm monster spell with a caster level equal to your class level. An affected animal can attempt a new saving throw each day to escape this effect. You can control any number of animals, so long as their total Hit Dice do not exceed your class level.

Eidolon Mount (Combat)
Your eidolon is capable of carrying you into combat with
great skill.
Prerequisite: Eidolon able to choose quadruped or
serpentine as a base form.
Benefit: Your eidolon is capable of serving you as a
combat-trained mount. If the eidolon’s base form is
not quadruped or serpentine, it also gains the ability to
transmute its physical body into a form suitable for you
to ride. This functions as the change shape ability, except
the eidolon’s base form changes to either quadruped or
serpentine and its size changes to be one size category larger
than its summoner’s base size. Unlike other changes to size,
this ability doesn’t increase the eidolon’s ability scores, reach,
or weapon damage beyond that of its true form. (However,
if the eidolon’s size is reduced by this ability, its reach and
weapon damage are adjusted accordingly.)
If the eidolon’s base form is not quadruped or serpentine
when it gains this feat, it chooses which base form
(quadruped or serpentine) to assume when using this
ability. The eidolon cannot choose a base form that is not
available to its subtype with this ability. If both base forms
are available to the eidolon’s subtype, it can change which
base form it assumes when using this ability whenever it
gains a new Hit Die. The eidolon can select evolutions that
have either base form as a requirement, but any evolutions
that require one of the base forms (but not the other)
provide no benefit while the eidolon is assuming the shape
of its other base form.

Energized Wild Shape
Your wild shape form gains the benefits of one energy type
for both offensive and defensive purposes.
Prerequisites: Wis 19, base attack bonus +6, wild shape
class feature.
Benefit: When you assume a wild shape form, choose one
of the following energy types: acid, cold, electricity, or fire. You
gain resistance 10 to that energy type. Also, one of your natural
attacks deals an additional 1d6 points of damage of the chosen
energy type. If you choose a wild shape form that already has
energy resistance of the same type you choose, it increases by 5
instead. If you choose a wild shape form that deals damage of
the same energy type you choose, increase the energy damage
you deal by one die size (1d6 becomes 1d8, and so on).
Special: You can take this feat more than once. Each time
you take this feat, choose a different energy type.

Enhanced Gnome Magic
Your ties to the First World manifest in the form of magical
abilities that tap into a natural element.
Prerequisites: Cha 13, Knowledge (nature) 3 ranks, gnome,
gnome magic racial trait.
Benefit: Add one of the following to your gnome magic
spell-like abilities: burning hands, corrosive touch UM , gentle
breeze ACG , icicle dagger UM , or shocking grasp. You can use this
spell-like ability once per day.

Exotic Heritage
Your blood carries hints of an extraplanar ancestor, granting
you a talent for a certain skill.
Benefit: Choose a skill. You gain a +2 bonus on skill checks
with that skill. If you have 10 or more ranks in the chosen skill,
this bonus increases to +4. This bonus does not stack with that
granted by Skill Focus. This feat counts as Skill Focus with
the chosen skill for the purpose of meeting the prerequisites
of the Eldritch Heritage UM feat. When you select Eldritch
Heritage, if you use this feat as a prerequisite, you can choose
a mutated version of your chosen bloodline as though you
were a sorcerer with the wildblooded UM archetype. All other
restrictions and requirements of Eldritch Heritage still apply.

Expert Cartographer
You are skilled at drawing quality maps, making your
cartographic works both more useful and more valuable
when sold.
Prerequisite: Craft (maps) 3 ranks.
Benefit: You gain a +4 bonus on Craft (maps) checks when
creating a map, as well as 1 additional Discovery Point (see
page 124 for more information about Discovery Points). If
you succeed at the check by 5 or more, the list price of the
map increases by 20%%.

Expert Explorer
You are trained to seek out the unknown places of the wild
and can explore more efficiently than your untrained rivals.
Prerequisite: Knowledge (nature) or Survival 5 ranks.
Benefit: You gain a +2 bonus on skill checks when using
the exploration rules presented on pages 124–125 to detect
features in a territory. If you succeed at such a skill check by
5 or more, you gain an additional 1d4 Discovery Points.
