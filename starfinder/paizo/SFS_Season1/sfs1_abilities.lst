##Copaxi
SIZE AND TYPE		KEY:Copaxi Default ~ SIZE AND TYPE			SORTKEY:c1		CATEGORY:Racial Trait		TYPE:Racial Trait.Copaxi Racial Trait		DESC:Copaxis are Medium humanoids with the copaxi subtype.		SOURCELONG:SFS Scenario #1-22

BLINDSENSE		KEY:Copaxi Default ~ BLINDSENSE			SORTKEY:c2		CATEGORY:Racial Trait		TYPE:Racial Trait.Copaxi Racial Trait		DESC:Copaxis’ sensitive polyps grant them blindsense (scent)—the ability to detect trace chemicals and scents in their environment—out to 30 feet. A copaxi ignores the Stealth bonuses from any form of visual camouflage, invisibility, and the like when attempting a Perception check opposed by a creature’s Stealth check. Even on a successful Perception check, any foe that can’t be seen still has total concealment (50%% miss chance) against a copaxi, and the copaxi still has the normal miss chance when attacking foes that have concealment. A copaxi is still flat-footed against attacks from creatures it can’t see.		SOURCELONG:SFS Scenario #1-22		BONUS:VAR|BlindsenseRange|30|TYPE=Base

GRAVITY ADJUSTMENT		KEY:Copaxi Default ~ GRAVITY ADJUSTMENT			SORTKEY:c3		CATEGORY:Racial Trait		TYPE:Racial Trait.Copaxi Racial Trait		DESC:Copaxis retain some of their ancient connection to the gravitational forces of the universe. A copaxi can adjust their personal gravity as a standard action. This adjustment remains in effect until the copaxi spends another standard action to return to their environment’s natural gravity. Entering an environment with a different gravity also cancels the copaxi’s ongoing adjustment. A copaxi can treat high or low gravity as standard gravity or treat standard gravity as high or low gravity. These adjustments only affect the copaxi and anything the copaxi is carrying; they do not affect thrown weapons. The copaxi cannot adjust to or from extreme or zero gravity.		SOURCELONG:SFS Scenario #1-22

REGENERATIVE EVOLUTION		KEY:Copaxi Default ~ REGENERATIVE EVOLUTION			SORTKEY:c4		CATEGORY:Racial Trait		TYPE:Racial Trait.Copaxi Racial Trait		DESC:A copaxi gradually reshapes its body and neural networks to overcome new challenges. Each time a copaxi gains a level, it can retrain all the choices of one previous character level, as though it had used a mnemonic editor (Starfinder Core Rulebook 226). They must have qualified for any new selections at the retrained level.		SOURCELONG:SFS Scenario #1-22

NATURAL COMMUNICATOR		KEY:Copaxi Default ~ NATURAL COMMUNICATOR			SORTKEY:c5		CATEGORY:Racial Trait		TYPE:Racial Trait.Copaxi Racial Trait		DESC:A copaxi quickly adapts to and adopts new forms of communication.
